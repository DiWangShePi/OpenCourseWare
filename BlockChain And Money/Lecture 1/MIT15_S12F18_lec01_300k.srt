00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,300
Welcome

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,440
welcome

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,800
If you have a desire to learn a little bit about blockchain and its intersection with the world of finance and money

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,670
And you're looking for 15 dot s 12

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
You are in the right place

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,940
If you're here to not do that and just hang out and have a good time

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,000
I guess you still hopefully are in the right place because we're going to have a good time this semester

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,390
My name is Gary Gensler

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,380
I'm a senior lecturer here at MIT Sloan

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,290
I'm also an advisor over at the MIT media lab

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,850
and I've spent a lifetime around the world of finance and money and public policy

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,380
And I bid at MIT this last eight months

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,040
And we're going to learn a lot together about blockchain and money

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,090
We're going to have a little bit of fun here and see what we're gonna do

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
So we're talking about blockchain money

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,890
That's where we are

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,350
By the way

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,710
I do cold call

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
I do call on you if you want to leave

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,180
Now

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,010
I understand

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,630
Because I want to have an interaction a little bit about it

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,270
So my first question for the class

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,910
for everyone

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,300
whether registered or not

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
how many of you have ever owned a cryptocurrency

32
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,550
Wait

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:39,740
wait

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,070
Let's see the odds

35
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,990
It seems like it's about 45% of you or so

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,850
All right

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,360
Excuse me

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,100
The line You want to keep your hand up long

39
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,990
You need to make

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,700
and how many of you have ever worked on any blockchain related projects in an entrepreneurial setting or corporate setting anywhere

41
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:05,770
Alright

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,140
good

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,440
So about a third in the room

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:10,930
Good

45
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,790
all right

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,570
So you all know probably more than I do

47
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,380
but I'm going to give it a shot

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,190
I'm going to always start every week with what are the study questions for the week

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
How many of you actually got the syllabus

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,640
This is not going to be greater to Simon

51
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,890
I just have to have a sense of who's who actually got this syllabus

52
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,830
So good many of

53
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,080
And how many of you actually did the two readings

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,110
It's not graded

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,810
I just got to gauge the class

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,360
Oh

57
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,170
thank you

58
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,060
Thank you

59
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,120
Write those grades down

60
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,330
by the way

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,880
no

62
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,230
All right

63
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,840
So the two main questions for this week's lecture really is what is blockchain and why might it be a catalyst

64
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,550
And I emphasize the word

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
might it be a catalyst for change in the world of finance

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,680
We could talk about a lot about things outside of the world of finance and blockchain may indeed have a lot of applications outside of finance

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,470
but I've chosen to try to just narrow the scope a bit

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,590
So this semester

69
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,730
really about blockchain and money or blockchain and finance

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,600
And secondly

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,500
you will see index cards on every one of these round tables

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,940
One assignment by the end of the class

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,020
you could do it now or later

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,530
I would like each of you to anonymously write on the court what you want to achieve this semester

75
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,730
It can be anything from this class

76
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,130
from learning about blockchain

77
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,370
from making money on Bitcoin from

78
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,900
I don't care if you tell me it's meeting your future spouse

79
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,590
I just like

80
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,130
what do you want to achieve in this class

81
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,350
I can't help you on the third

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,830
but I will try to help you on the things I can help you out

83
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,790
And Sabrina and Toledo will collect them later

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,060
And next Tuesday will tell you the results

85
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,370
What is it that you want to achieve in this class

86
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
And then we'll see at the end of the semester if we've done that

87
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,990
So that's just a way to help guide me

88
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,820
help you

89
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,120
So that's that's what we're trying to do

90
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,370
And so what were the two readings

91
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,820
One was a little thing I did

92
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,010
And one was a thing I did with some of my colleagues

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,620
And Tom

94
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,930
since I know you would you take out of the readings

95
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,530
that watching potential to improve the profitability or the the second one

96
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,220
Did you have a good summer

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,290
Yeah

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,110
did you raise your head

99
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,560
Did you own Bitcoin

100
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:34,680
No

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,700
Who in the class read the readings and took something different than Tom

102
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,910
He said there was potential in your first name

103
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,190
Alex

104
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:46,880
Well

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm coming from the technical side

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,300
So from the technical side

107
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,600
all I see is a bunch of hype

108
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,940
And 10 years have passed since the launch of Bitcoin is very little show for it other than height

109
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,800
So I just got

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,680
okay

111
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,770
how many agreed with Elon

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,730
This isn't a vote or just two or three have any grid with Tom says more

113
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,210
And how many of you are too shy on the first day to put your hands up

114
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,460
So I'm going to start and go back the internet

115
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,330
How do I sort of I've come about this and sort of thought about

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,750
well

117
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,770
what is blockchain

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
What is it really about

119
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,890
Well

120
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,050
the internet started many decades ago before most of you were born

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,050
But 1974

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,420
I mean

123
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,810
there's some predecessors

124
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,280
even from the late sixty's

125
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,240
the Ethernet

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,060
which is really how two computers communicate

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,850
And then you had TCP IP

128
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,880
which is really the internet protocol of multiple computers

129
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,000
Compute talking to each other

130
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,400
And then later on in 1990

131
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,710
how do we move forward

132
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,790
Does anybody know what Http is

133
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,120
Where at MIT

134
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,960
Your first name would be helpful

135
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:11,740
Eric Eric is a is a probable for communicate the the web content web content type protects the transportation

136
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:11,990
right

137
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,960
You know who

138
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,420
Who's associated with the invention

139
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,490
And I don't remember right now

140
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,630
Anybody else

141
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,530
Anybody know who it's not In the readings running

142
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,750
Tim spurred league

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,150
Anybody know who's associated with TCP IP

144
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,950
It was a company initiated by MIT Acrylic

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,950
I think the bubble bag or something

146
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,910
I don't know if it was a company associated with MIT

147
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,530
but Vince Surf may have had some association with MIT

148
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,000
So these are the first three layers

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then there were companies commercialization

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,290
3Com and Cisco

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,310
And of course

152
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,950
Amazon is still around today

153
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
But there is something else going on

154
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,700
How do we commercialize the internet

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,570
Does anybody know what this scene is from

156
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,760
This is the first pizza sold by with Bitcoin

157
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,110
Good thought

158
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,640
Good thought

159
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,240
First pizza sold by Bitcoin

160
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,720
But no

161
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,490
Is it from that movie hackers or something

162
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,010
Alright

163
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,260
movie hackers

164
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,650
I do from net the net

165
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,290
Do you know

166
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
Have you ever seen the movie

167
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,240
It's not a good movie

168
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,130
So this is the opening scene of the net

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,080
And yes

170
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,230
that's Sander Bullock

171
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,730
And the year is 1995

172
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,320
It's a cyber thriller

173
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,770
You know

174
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,070
a presidents involved

175
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,130
the defense departments involved and so forth

176
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,880
But actually

177
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:56,020
Pizza Hut is associated with the very first sale online sale anywhere in the world

178
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,620
They started something called Pizza nut

179
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,750
This was the screen

180
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,450
by the way

181
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,880
If you wanted to go on

182
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,050
you could order your pizza

183
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,900
And and but there was one problem

184
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,360
Does anybody know what the problem was with pizza Net

185
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,080
I mean

186
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,750
maybe there were multiple problems

187
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,510
No

188
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,770
a lot

189
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,600
I've caught on you

190
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,810
You couldn't pay

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,490
All right

192
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,940
You couldn't pay online

193
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,490
Nobody figured out how to move money online

194
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,900
You had to pay when you showed up with the pizza

195
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,386
So now I'm going to talk a little bit about cryptography

196
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:30,320
We're going to spend a lot of time on cryptography

197
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,336
It's is cryptocurrencies and and the like

198
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,100
What's your name

199
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,100
GG

200
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,390
GE

201
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,980
GE

202
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,330
GE

203
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,320
what's cryptography

204
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,860
Assume that the something crafty

205
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,890
cryptic

206
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,140
Alright

207
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,540
now you got it

208
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,980
You gotta start there

209
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,000
Anybody want to help GE out

210
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,470
Does anybody want to help GE out

211
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,140
Yeah

212
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,090
tell me your first aid

213
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,910
We're going to ask

214
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,650
We're going to figure out how to have everybody have name plates by next week

215
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,840
But we'll work with Ryan and do it that way

216
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,540
But idea

217
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,100
Yeah

218
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,730
it's the technology or the science behind encryption and decryption codification

219
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,930
So how do you encrypt a particular Texas that is not readable by someone else without having the decryption

220
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:14,840
Okay

221
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,010
so it's how do you encrypt something

222
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,600
So it's not detectable by others or in essence

223
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,480
its communications in the presence of adversaries

224
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:33,830
You have an adversary who wants the communication you want to communicate and not let your adversaries know that communications

225
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,270
And this is this is true for ancient times

226
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,850
So in ancient times

227
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,470
there was something called the cipher

228
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:55,840
And this was a way that you take a piece of leather or piece of cloth and have a lot of letters and both sides you'd encrypt and decrypt because they were measurements of the cylinder

229
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,620
Has anybody seen the the movie imitation games

230
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,610
Alright

231
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,580
the Enigma machine

232
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,960
Now the movie was wonderful because it said touring cracked it and he did help crack it in an automated way

233
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,500
But actually

234
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,990
the Polish government had cracked it in the S before they fell to the Germans

235
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,880
But and and touring built on all of that and and cracked it

236
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,220
And then in the 1970s

237
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,120
And this was here at MIT

238
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,130
To some extent

239
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,960
There is private key public key cryptography

240
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,660
which I'm not going to dive into today

241
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,540
But it's the heart of Bitcoin and blockchain

242
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,650
It's at the heart of the Internet

243
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,120
But it's about the key thing is communications in the presence of adversaries

244
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,770
How do you keep a secret when everybody wants in and get that information

245
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,560
And there's a long history

246
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,900
And MIT is at the center of a lot of that

247
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,720
A lot of early cryptography failed on the Internet in the early 90s and late 80s

248
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,970
David Chum and others tried to do things

249
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,460
And we're not going to debate these today

250
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,220
But you all have one reading

251
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,880
I think it's either next week which will give you that history

252
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,800
And it's worthwhile knowing about the history of failure

253
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,740
But cryptography is the reason why the Internet works today

254
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,150
Does anybody want to tell me what SSL and TL

255
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,340
TLS is

256
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,180
We have any computer scientists remind me your first name

257
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,890
Eric

258
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,540
That's

259
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,810
the protocol that Madam Sun top of the TCP IP stack to description using asymmetric case

260
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,460
which is public infrastructure cryptography

261
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,180
That's a cube socket layer is trying to lose it

262
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,380
So it basically uses asymmetric cryptography

263
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,620
which we're gonna talk about two lectures from now

264
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,590
But it secures the whole internet

265
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,640
So all of a sudden

266
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,710
you could deliver the pizza and get APS code

267
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,220
And I have to tell you

268
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,400
I never knew how this worked before I was at MIT

269
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,520
So PayPal came along in 1998

270
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,770
I mentioned this a whole bunch of other digital currencies then failed

271
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,130
But some of these people who will read later

272
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,420
like we'll read Nick Sabo piece on smart contracts later

273
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,860
Adam back

274
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,780
who created Hashcash

275
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,580
Some of these innovations were what Satoshi Nakamoto later used to

276
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,980
Some innovations which were really helpful and worked were Alipay and M Pesa

277
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,780
Does anybody know what MP says

278
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,150
I think it's used in Kenya as like mobile cellular enabled cash

279
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,370
right

280
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,160
In essence

281
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,460
they found out in Kenya

282
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,000
This was 1012 years ago that people were trading mobile minutes

283
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,030
They were unbanked

284
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,960
but they had cellular phones and they were trading their minutes as a form of currency and safari

285
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,750
Khan realized that and said we could help people be part of the digital economy

286
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,550
even if they are unbanked

287
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,390
And in Africa today

288
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,370
a half of the adult population

289
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,090
according to World Bank figures

290
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,380
is still unbacked

291
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,380
But half of that half has mobile phones

292
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,680
MP says 20 million customers in Kenya right now

293
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,230
So it's A

294
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,360
it's a form of money that's kind of swapping mobile minutes

295
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,080
But the riddle remained

296
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,120
How do you move money on the internet

297
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,810
Or in essence

298
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,720
how do you move value peer to peer without a centralized intermediary

299
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,440
And that's the

300
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,370
Of blockchain technology

301
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,220
So who solved the riddle and everybody to tell me who solve the riddle

302
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,930
Who solve this riddle now

303
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah

304
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,460
yeah

305
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,620
You're

306
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,510
you're wearing a tshirt that says Quentin Tarantino

307
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,050
So I think Quentin Tarantino should solve a riddle

308
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,190
What's that

309
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,140
What's your name

310
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,120
Ruth is

311
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,340
And who saw this riddle

312
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,530
So appear to peer cash

313
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,510
This is the actual dock top of an email that was sent out on Halloween

314
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,070
2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto

315
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,270
We don't actually know who Satoshi Nakamoto is

316
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,590
but it's a study question in a few lectures from now to ask you to tell me who you think Satoshi Nakamoto is

317
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,110
So I want to ask you that now

318
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,560
And he started with a very simple sentence in his email

319
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:59,030
I've been working on a new electronic cash system that fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third

320
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,310
It's kind of a modest statement

321
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,240
And so the question is

322
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,710
is this another internet layer

323
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,760
We're going to explore that this whole semester

324
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,260
I don't

325
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,670
I don't really have the answer

326
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:22,630
I don't think the best minds at MIT could really yet tell you there are some who are maximized and say

327
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,070
yes

328
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,260
it will be

329
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,540
And there are others who will say

330
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,620
no

331
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,500
And in this course

332
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,940
we're going to

333
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,330
we're going to review the minimalist and the Maximus

334
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,110
We're not

335
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,620
we're not going to try to center it in one place

336
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,970
But that's the key kind of question

337
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,300
So what is a block chain

338
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,767
We're going to do this in a lot of lectures

339
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:46,330
but I'm going to try to do it in in a short version

340
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,335
So it's time to stamp append logs

341
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:53,500
meaning you can add a little bit of information to this

342
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,910
And it's time stamped

343
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,760
So these are these blocks being added

344
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,380
Satoshi did not invent blockchain

345
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,440
This way earlier

346
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,900
does anybody want to guess what

347
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,770
what it was

348
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,530
You're going to have a reading about this later

349
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,860
But early 1990s

350
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,810
On the Stewart

351
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,450
What's that

352
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,180
Madores Stuart Hammer

353
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
Stewart Haber

354
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,090
Stewart Haber worked for Bell Labs

355
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,540
right

356
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,950
So one of your assignments

357
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,330
It's not gonna be a graded assignment

358
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,710
Just gonna be a fun assignment

359
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,570
Could any of you are going to say by next Thursday just could have some fun

360
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,900
Find the longest in time wise

361
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,680
longest running blockchain

362
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,950
It's not Bitcoin

363
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,440
And it's been running since the mid 90s

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,340
And your clue is The New York Times

365
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,690
And and we'll discuss it next Thursday

366
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,106
But this timestamped block block

367
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:04,190
block block of data creates a database

368
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,050
an auditable database

369
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,700
And we'll talk about ledgers

370
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,890
particularly next week

371
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,270
But we'll talk about ledgers all throughout this course and how it changes the world of finance

372
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,070
Now it's secured by cryptography because cryptography remembers communications and making sure adversaries can't pick you off

373
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,170
We're going to learn about hash functions and hatch functions that are a really important part of cryptography

374
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:33,400
And initially for databases and how to search and store information and databases

375
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,420
But in this circumstances

376
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:44,080
hash functions were the way to not only append the next block to the prior blocks

377
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:51,880
but really importantly to compress data to make it more manipulative and verify it

378
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,740
And as I've written here

379
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,900
tamper resistance and the integrity

380
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,640
digital signatures

381
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,360
which has to do the public key

382
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,220
Private key cryptography

383
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,860
There is no prerequisite this course

384
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,820
You do not have had to have taken computer science cryptography algorithms

385
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,930
If I could learn a little bit about hash functions and asymmetric cryptography

386
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,260
these are the two key important sides

387
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,810
And we

388
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,500
we have enough computer scientists in this room that can sort us out if I say the wrong thing

389
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,210
right

390
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,030
Maduras hopefully

391
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,800
And then consensus

392
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:38,990
So there's a really important part of blockchain is how do you decide who appends that next block

393
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
Because when I went back here

394
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,890
there's block of block each of these blocks

395
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,980
Somebody has to decide who appends

396
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,230
who gets to pick the

397
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,900
And that's what's called consensus protocol

398
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,360
And there's wide debates about consensus protocol

399
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,200
And we'll talk a lot about consensus protocol

400
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,380
But in essence

401
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,660
it addresses something

402
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,410
a term called the cost of trust

403
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,080
And we'll talk about Byzantine general's problems

404
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,570
which is another reading

405
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,100
The Byzantine generals problem was laid out as a sort of mathematical game theory issue

406
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,120
Some 30th years

407
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,980
That's what Satoshi Nakamoto Soft was

408
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,950
This last part that the Byzantine general's from

409
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,580
Pizza for bitcoins

410
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,770
A year and a half after Satoshi Nakamoto laid out blockchain Bitcoin

411
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,780
somebody sent an email and you'll get these slides

412
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,220
But this is the real live email

413
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,050
I'll pay you 10000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas

414
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,110
I just want some pizzas

415
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,930
The guy who sent this

416
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,370
he says

417
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,190
I like onions

418
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,570
pepper

419
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,120
sausage

420
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,880
mushrooms

421
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,380
Lazlo

422
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,695
Now catch the date

423
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:54,755
This is May 18th

424
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:59,900
And he's offering 10000 bitcoins of 2010

425
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,650
But the key line is what I'm aiming for is getting food deliver in exchange for bitcoins

426
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,260
Nobody had used bitcoins as a medium of exchange

427
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,660
16 months into its existence

428
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,340
nobody had used it to buy something

429
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,530
And last low as a computer scientist in Florida was just kind of interested

430
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,820
And he put this ad on a on a an email list

431
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,950
Three days later

432
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,610
he still doesn't have his two pizzas

433
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,370
so nobody wants to buy me a pizza

434
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,350
Is the Bitcoin amount I'm offering too

435
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,620
Another day goes by

436
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,290
He gets his pizzas and he post pictures

437
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,720
So here's a picture of his child reaching for those Papa John pizzas

438
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,140
Anybody know what those 10000 bitcoins were worth back in back then

439
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,000
Chicago

440
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,050
I like the work now

441
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,090
Anybody want to say back that

442
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,600
What's that

443
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,170
$41

444
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,810
And Lasla was saying two pizzas are probably worth 25 to 30 because there's a whole email thread

445
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,430
He kept saying

446
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,100
why won't anybody get me my pizzas

447
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,920
You can make money on this today

448
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,860
Who are earlier

449
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,050
late yet last night

450
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,710
$66 billion

451
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,680
Yeah

452
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,960
So it's a kind of a cute story

453
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,620
May 22

454
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,030
Every year is called Pizza Day or Bitcoin Pizza Day or something

455
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,050
So what is blockchain technology

456
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,070
These are my words

457
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,910
But they're sort of picked from the literature and so forth

458
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:53,430
It verifiably moves data on a decentralized network and the economics of blockchain technology are are really around that verification in the economics of verification and the economics of networking

459
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,040
And in many ways

460
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:03,510
blockchain adds certain costs to the verification through this consensus protocol that will be studying

461
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,490
But it lowers some other costs of verification because you're not relying on a centralized authority

462
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,780
So it's really a trade off of cost of verification

463
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,950
I don't think it's

464
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,810
I'm not a purest

465
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,250
It says it's better or worse

466
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,310
but it's it's a tradeoff of cost of verification through decentralized networks

467
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,750
The data can be value

468
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,310
Like Bitcoin was a money system

469
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,740
Or the data can be actually computer code

470
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,440
And we'll learn a lot about smart contracts

471
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,110
And you could have the data being verified

472
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,770
computer code and algorithms and

473
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,460
My world finance

474
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:53,630
This directly goes to the plumbing of finance because finance is fundamentally about moving money and risk through a network

475
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,310
And that network is the 7 billion people that live in this world

476
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,020
It's moving money and risk

477
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,470
And you've all taken finance courses

478
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,000
or many of you have

479
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,440
And it's the intermediation of money and risks throughout our economy

480
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,220
But there's a whole host of challenges

481
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,650
And over the course of this semester

482
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,550
we'll talk about this challenges technical

483
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,620
commercial and public policy hurdles

484
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,440
Will they be solved

485
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,130
Will they not be soft

486
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,820
But it could be a catalyst

487
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,660
But we're not sure yet for change in the world of money and finance

488
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,260
So does anybody want to tell me the the role of money in society

489
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,460
And tell me your first name

490
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,000
Tomas Tomas

491
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,560
Basically

492
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,680
it's a way to

493
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,620
exchange things themselves between people

494
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,270
Alright

495
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,890
medium of exchange

496
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Got that one without doing battery

497
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,510
I mean

498
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,270
exchange

499
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,890
This is a medium of exchange

500
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,470
So when you give me a second

501
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,730
yellow shirt

502
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,090
Yeah

503
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,190
medium of saving savings

504
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,570
All right

505
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,310
so that would be a store of value

506
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,110
Third

507
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,630
I'm sorry

508
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,550
the gentleman here

509
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,840
You need to account

510
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,160
You need to have account

511
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,750
Wow

512
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,100
alright

513
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,870
there we go

514
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,130
Here we go

515
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,180
So we're going to spend some time next Tuesday talking more about money and the role of money in the history of money

516
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,630
Which I think is sort of lays a foundational piece of this

517
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,740
What about the role of finance

518
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,940
I've already sort of said a few things about that

519
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,166
But and I'm

520
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:35,912
I'm sorry

521
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,405
I don't know your name

522
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,648
but I'm right here

523
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:39,146
woman

524
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:39,395
Yeah

525
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,390
role of finance

526
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,640
Sorry

527
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,170
I'm not going to tell any financial finance professor what your answer is

528
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,450
To raise money

529
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,330
So keep

530
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,020
keep going

531
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,090
I'm going to anybody else want it

532
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,130
Connect

533
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,090
connect savers and borrowers

534
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,920
Can you connect savers and bars

535
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,270
So connecting is sort of moving money

536
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,980
moving

537
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,715
make valuations

538
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:10,499
valuations

539
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:13,635
So that's the pieces of it sort of moving

540
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:14,942
making valuations

541
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,772
I use the words moving

542
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:18,340
allocating and pricing

543
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,330
Pricing is the valuations of money

544
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,470
But let's not forget

545
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,220
it's also about risk when you buy insurance

546
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,690
That's a transference of risk when you buy an equity stock

547
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,800
that's a transference of risk

548
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,730
If you enter into a complex credit to fault swap

549
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,600
it's a transference of risk

550
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,380
So finance is not just the movement of money

551
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:48,010
it's the movement of risk as well throughout the economy

552
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,550
And I always think finance

553
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,610
I always have thought this when I was at Goldman Sachs for 18 years

554
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,650
that finance sits at the neck of an hour glass

555
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,320
And it's why it collects so much economic rents from society

556
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,600
Because when you sit at the neck of an hour glass and billions

557
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,520
literally trillions of grains of sand go by

558
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:21,880
If you collect some of those grains as you get Uber wealth and that's those are for other classes

559
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,130
But finance can collect a lot of economic rents

560
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,120
The financial sector

561
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,280
though

562
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,610
has a bunch of challenges

563
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,260
We'll have one lecture later in the semester about some of those challenges

564
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,140
And we have a reading

565
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,410
I think Sheila Bear wrote something recently that I asked you all to read later in the semester

566
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,250
But we will talk about the financial crisis and some of the problems

567
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,030
But it's had a lot of crises

568
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,710
Fiat currencies have a lot of instabilities

569
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,720
Of course

570
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,470
we have centralized intermediaries

571
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,310
as I laid out

572
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,210
And we'll talk about collect a lot of economic rents

573
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,830
And so there's there's opportunity

574
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:03,420
Blockchain has real opportunity to kind of come under this world of finance and maybe do some things better

575
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:11,660
Central banking also have a bunch of legacy payment systems and those legacy payment systems are slowly adapting

576
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,760
but it's slow

577
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,610
And why did Alipay do so well in China is part of the story

578
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,180
Because there were so many unbanked

579
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,530
just like M Pesa in Kenya

580
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,080
But here in the us

581
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,720
we still pay two and a half to 3% for our interchange charges for Visa

582
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,920
MasterCard and and the like

583
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,870
And a lot of clearing and settlement still has a lot of counterparty risk

584
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,740
And one that I care deeply about financial inclusion

585
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,270
There's still 1

586
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,970
7 billion people in this world who are unbanked

587
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,120
And so we don't think of it as much in the developed countries

588
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,380
But it's certainly true in many products

589
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,660
even here in the US

590
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,490
And these are to be the opportunities

591
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,080
Finance is 7 1/2 percent of the US economy

592
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,840
That's $1

593
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,250
5 trillion of revenues

594
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,840
So any of you that are think about entrepreneurial opportunities

595
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,400
the payment system just here in the U S is a half a percent to 1% of our economy

596
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,910
That's 100 to $200 billion of revenues

597
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,450
I think Visa is about 18 billion just

598
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,840
you know

599
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,330
But you know

600
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,530
when you add up the whole payment system

601
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,130
that's 100 to $200 billion in payment revenues

602
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,640
So that's kind of the opportunity

603
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,790
Can blockchain technology come in

604
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,290
It's got problems

605
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,030
It's slow

606
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,360
It's it's performance issues still

607
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,120
But can it compete with that

608
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,720
Here are some of the problems the financial sector would say with blockchain

609
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,350
These are real live things that we're going to study later in the semester

610
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,290
They say it doesn't have the performance

611
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,100
scalability

612
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,340
a modern payment system

613
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,710
You need to be able to move about 100000 payments a second

614
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,980
a modern securities clearing

615
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,860
the Depository Trust Corporation

616
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,410
the Securities and Exchange Commission says you do about 30000 transactions a second

617
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,360
But we need you to scale and your computers and everything have to be resilient to a transactions

618
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,740
A second Bitcoin

619
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,510
you can do about 7 transactions

620
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:23,700
A second visa currently depends on the the second does anywhere from 20 to 70000 a second

621
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,110
you know

622
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,620
So it's just a sense of scalability and performance

623
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,630
We might get there

624
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,690
It might be 3 to 7 years away

625
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,390
optimistic

626
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,640
but there's still a bunch of performance and scalability issues

627
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,530
Privacy and security blockchains

628
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,070
by their nature or public

629
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,140
So they're not fully censorship resistant

630
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,840
but there's a lot of innovation about making them more private

631
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,600
But then that makes the public sector a little nervous

632
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,070
Interoperability

633
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,630
They don't necessarily work yet with other legacy systems or with each other

634
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,610
The Internet

635
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,490
one of the great innovations of the Internet

636
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:09,850
It became interoperable that that all of these different websites could kind of speak with each other

637
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,860
Governance is a very big issue we'll talk about

638
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,950
And one of the things about governance is it's hard to update the software of a block j

639
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,450
because if you create a decentralized where no one's in control

640
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,040
no one can collect economic rents

641
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:35,070
You also don't have sort of somebody with the ability to necessarily update the software

642
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,000
And we'll talk later about how Bitcoin updates its software and what Bitcoin core developers are and so forth

643
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,490
But FaceBook

644
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,620
you do know one thing

645
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:45,990
though

646
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:54,130
They're they're a company that collects a lot of profits and economic rents offer their 2 billion members

647
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,660
They know how to update their software

648
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,510
It's

649
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,790
it's a governance issue

650
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,050
That's a real life challenge

651
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,800
And that's why the financial sector says

652
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,370
I'm not sure this works

653
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,610
This is ready yet for me

654
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,670
And then thus

655
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,460
what are the commercial use cases and what are the public policy issues

656
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,030
So right now

657
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,230
the financial sector favors permission blockchains versus permission list

658
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,450
This is going to be about four weeks from now

659
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,410
We'll kind of go through these two differences

660
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,430
But I want to just frame this briefly

661
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,230
Permission

662
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,990
Blockchains have a known group of people who actually participate

663
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,930
The half of you that said you've owned Bitcoin

664
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,820
you know it to be something where anybody can update the ledger permission blockchains

665
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,240
You can't do that

666
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,610
In essence

667
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,740
you pick the three or 20

668
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,740
The Australian Stock Exchange is updating their clearing and settling

669
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,040
They announced they're doing a blockchain project

670
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,000
They're doing it with digital assets and they're using the Hyperledger blockchain

671
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,020
which is an IBM software open source software

672
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,690
But the Australian Stock Exchange is going to put it on three computers

673
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,590
which is called three nodes that they control

674
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,540
all three of them

675
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:22,240
The Depository Trust Corporation is looking at blockchain inspired solutions for some of their data warehouses

676
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,470
But they too are going to control the notes

677
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,020
I'm just giving it

678
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,240
That's permission

679
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,880
blockchains

680
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,090
There's nothing wrong with that

681
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,250
That's just how they are looking at this

682
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,920
Permissionless blockchains are like Bitcoin unknown participants

683
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,910
securities based on incentives

684
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,050
a cryptocurrency and crypto economics

685
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,970
Crypto finance is about 200 billion

686
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,130
But

687
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,390
you know

688
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,420
you have to update these slides daily

689
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,130
Two days ago

690
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,710
it was 230 billion

691
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,040
And this little pie chart is a little over half

692
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,070
Is Bitcoin

693
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,090
The next slice is something called Ethereum and then Ripple

694
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,270
And down the line

695
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,550
we're not going to spend a lot of time in this this semester

696
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,010
If you

697
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:12,810
if your goal is to how can you profit and trade day trade bitcoin and day trade ether

698
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,910
God bless

699
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,170
Good prosper

700
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,850
You could stay in the class

701
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,800
I just won't give you much advice on it

702
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,060
You know

703
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,500
this is not a crypto investing centered class

704
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,160
but I'm okay if that's what you're doing

705
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,570
Does anybody know what the worldwide capital market size is

706
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,070
Anybody want to guess

707
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,570
You know

708
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,090
this is 200 billion

709
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,140
What's it look like

710
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,580
I've already said it's modest

711
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,590
Hundreds of trillions

712
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,290
hundreds of trillions

713
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,240
Global equity about global bond and debt markets

714
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,150
250 trio

715
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:59,880
So it's still quite modest compared to that broad breadth of of capital formation and gold

716
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,370
If if bitcoins digital gold

717
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,910
what's the value of gold

718
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,250
All the goal that's ever been time

719
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,170
6 or 7 trillion

720
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:09,700
Yeah

721
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,420
7 trillion

722
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:10,780
yeah

723
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,370
So just give you a sense of scale

724
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:22,290
So there's also something that's interesting about this space is that it's outsize public attention

725
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:29,950
even as evidenced by the hundred of you in this room versus the size

726
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,830
It is real relative to the capital markets today

727
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah

728
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,230
there's a bunch of public policy issues

729
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,520
Will have a lecture

730
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,780
I'm a former regulator

731
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,290
I ran the commodity future trading commission

732
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,920
So

733
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,170
but this course is not about regulation

734
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:44,390
though

735
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,320
We have to always come back to regulation

736
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,030
We always have to infuse what we're doing with the regulation

737
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,470
But let me just give you a little framework

738
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,640
And then you have to be bored in a handful of weeks and read

739
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,820
I gave some congressional testimony on it

740
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,060
Yes

741
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,400
it will be required reading

742
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,480
Sorry

743
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,100
but it's guarding against illicit activity

744
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:18,200
A lot of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies started out in the cyber punk sort of movement and libertarian movement

745
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,180
so forth

746
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,300
And it is true

747
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,490
You can use this for illicit activity

748
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,280
absolutely

749
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,120
But I would say crime is not new

750
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,950
Just the mechanisms and means are new

751
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
And so the criminals

752
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,560
yes

753
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,390
will use this and have used it for illicit activity

754
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,010
financial stability

755
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,200
Central bankers around the globe sort of

756
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,070
Will this shape finance

757
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,250
Well

758
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,990
it's only 200 billion

759
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,400
The financial markets are 300 trillion plus not yet is generally what they're saying

760
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,290
But for some countries

761
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,330
it's a way to get around capital controls

762
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,130
And so for those countries worried about capital controls

763
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,030
it's a very real and live set of issues

764
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,640
And then protecting the investing public

765
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,900
And when we do this in a few weeks

766
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,320
I'll go through each of these

767
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,030
the investor protection issues

768
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,500
And yes

769
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,220
the SEC

770
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:16,650
how we test and and and the like for those who wish to do their own initial coin offering

771
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,660
I'll give some

772
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,070
you know

773
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,030
broad sense of what the Sec is trying to accomplish

774
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,500
But it's a moving target

775
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,920
So this is a very interesting thing as opposed to many of your Sloan classes or your C cell classes or media lab classes

776
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,320
This is a very unsettled area of public policy

777
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,460
So it makes it and and and and if you all go off and form companies

778
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:46,830
you will actually be helping sort of set the the the edge of that public policy

779
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,460
At day 8

780
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,550
I would always say

781
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,760
just remember poet Riley

782
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,500
the duck test

783
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,140
This is a poet

784
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,370
Indiana poet

785
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,360
So those are from the US might not know the duck test

786
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,450
But basically if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck

787
00:36:59,450 --> 00:36:59,840
it's a duck

788
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,780
So whenever you're thinking about public policy

789
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,160
folks like myself who once was a regulator

790
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,320
we think in the duck test

791
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:15,490
And then we secondarily think about the actual words in the Congressional Act

792
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,360
You know

793
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,790
where's the common sense

794
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,340
And if it quacks and walks like a duck

795
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,840
it's probably a security or it's probably this or that

796
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:33,940
The incumbents like this lioness in the corner are eyeing this space because there's a lot of volatility

797
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,290
And Wall Street makes money on volatility

798
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,090
Volatility is the friend of wall

799
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,940
It might not be the friend of investors

800
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,100
but it's a friend of Wall Street

801
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,830
And they also like the trading volumes and the spreads

802
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,110
Coinbase

803
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,410
the largest crypto exchange here in the USS 20 million accounts

804
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,900
They might not all be active

805
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,830
but that's the size of Fidelity's membership or account list

806
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,620
And twice D E Shaw and Robin Hood

807
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,040
How many of you have ever used

808
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,230
Robin Hood is a trading app

809
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,150
Wow

810
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,000
half of you

811
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,100
So you know

812
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,510
free trading

813
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,060
right

814
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,610
5 million members

815
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,710
For those who don't know

816
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,280
you can download Robin Hood and you can trade stocks for free

817
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,690
No commission if anybody's interested

818
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,560
Show up and I'll do office hours

819
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
Wonder how Robin Hood commercializes

820
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,600
They commercialize your order flow and they make money without charging your commissions

821
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,770
But it's a sort of wonderful app

822
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,400
Millennials love it

823
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,060
5 million members already

824
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:42,560
So you better believe DE Shaw and the incumbents are worried about things like that

825
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,170
The startups are also more willing to beg for forgiveness from regulators

826
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,280
They're willing to sort of take risks and beg for forgiveness

827
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,940
whereas incumbents tend to have to ask for permission

828
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,860
So there's an unlevel field that always

829
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:02,900
it's an asymmetric business set of risk about regulatory risk

830
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,650
Not always

831
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,020
I'm not like crying for JP Morgan

832
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,020
I mean

833
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,820
the big incumbents have also they have their and Coinbase is becoming an incumbent rather than just a

834
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,440
you know

835
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,700
Startup in a sense

836
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,241
And we'll talk during the semester about some of the incumbents

837
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,915
We're we're probably going to get Jeff Sp

838
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:27,560
Reckers here in mid November

839
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:35,991
He's going to talk to you about what Intercontinental exchange in the New York Stock Exchange is doing with Starbucks and Microsoft and the like

840
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,842
The financial sector use cases

841
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,899
I'm not going to go through these

842
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:44,423
but this is the second half of the course is going to go through each of these

843
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,714
And we'll do one to two sessions on each payment system

844
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:48,330
Central bank

845
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,359
digital currency

846
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,798
secondary market trading

847
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:55,940
the venture capital and initial coin offering space will do two course on that and move through

848
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,740
So what are we going to do in this whole course

849
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,780
Basically

850
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,370
our goal is to learn the fundamentals

851
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,210
That's about roughly the first half of the course

852
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,400
Pivot to two sessions on the economics

853
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,560
We're going to be talking about the economics throughout the whole course

854
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,010
But I want to

855
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,700
I want to really just focus

856
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:23,410
drill down on the economics on two of the discussions and then riff through the financial space for the second half

857
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,080
That's our journey together

858
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:27,440
To me

859
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,140
it's for anybody who wants to gain critical reasoning skills

860
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,950
This is not just kind of a

861
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,550
hey

862
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,090
this is going to change the world and revolutionize everything class

863
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,240
And so I basically think of an old Defense Department term called ground truths

864
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,190
It's when the general doesn't really know what's going on

865
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,920
but needs to figure it out and needs to talk to that

866
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,820
You know that that corporal on the ground

867
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,260
there's got dirt

868
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:56,700
you know

869
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,190
all over them and it's been shot up and says

870
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,390
Here's the real ground truth

871
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,630
We're going to try to talk about ground truth in this

872
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,230
in this

873
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:17,880
in this class and separate the mere assertion from the hype And some of your readings will be some real Bitcoin and blockchain minimalists from Noriel Rubini that uses words

874
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm not supposed to repeat on a recording about this stuff to Paul Krugman

875
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,940
who and Joe Stiglitz and other Nobel laureates who say

876
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:28,730
no

877
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,310
It's not going to work or Warren Buffett to to Maximus

878
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,570
We're gonna try to cover both sides

879
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,040
Larry Lessig is honoring me because he's in the back of the class

880
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,620
who is an enormously esteemed professor from Harvard

881
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,520
I didn't know Larry was going to be here

882
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,930
And I did the slide before

883
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,390
But in 1909

884
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,510
I think you wrote this book

885
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,100
Larry

886
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,880
Is that right

887
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,420
Code and other laws of cyberspace

888
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,380
I put you on them

889
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,380
but I think it's worthwhile to think about Larry's 4 b here

890
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,070
And I don't know

891
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,400
Larry

892
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,360
if you want to say anything

893
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,800
but I'm going to try to infuse this course

894
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,180
And just how you think about this

895
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,860
the tech we're at MIT

896
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,360
the technology

897
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:21,670
And we're going to get you a lot of technology if you want more than I can give you is is a former finance sort of tight my whole life

898
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,560
There's going to be a bunch of computer science people in the class

899
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:35,430
we're going to hook and you up together with the folks from the media lab and sea sale and try to connect you to the technology side

900
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,090
If you want to swim deeper in that pond

901
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,210
But the technology really

902
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,810
really matters

903
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,740
And that's why we are going to go through hash functions and go through asymmetric cryptography and so forth

904
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,790
From a business perspective

905
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,960
markets matter

906
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,770
Why is it that incumbents or startups or are not doing this and that

907
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,130
Why is it 10 years in

908
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,590
And nobody's got an enterprisewide solution yet to payments that use block J

909
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,410
The law matters

910
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,610
The public policy

911
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,720
side manners

912
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,290
And the fourth of Larrys layout social norms

913
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,950
That's a little harder for me to teach

914
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,840
That's not what this class is about

915
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,810
But it also affects all this

916
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,590
It's not just the technology

917
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,680
the markets in the law

918
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,940
So it's not just a three legged stool

919
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,180
It's kind of a four legged stool

920
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,150
How do I do

921
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,580
Larry

922
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,170
I suppose

923
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:28,600
yeah

924
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:28,720
Alright

925
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,180
I really didn't know how he was going to be here

926
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,370
So

927
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:43,400
but I wanted to give you a framework for how your faculty member thinks and will be on this journey together

928
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,930
Range of perspectives

929
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,880
We're not going to be a Bitcoin minimalist or maximalist

930
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,780
I'm probably to be self-disclosed here a little bit

931
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:59,500
Center minimalist on bitcoin Smart contract minimalist max list

932
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,330
I'm probably pretty center

933
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,380
Larry is probably a little bit center max malice

934
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,300
I'm guessing

935
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,680
First off

936
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,370
I'm hoping I can be

937
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,810
but you're going to teach me whether I can do

938
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,350
Oh

939
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,220
so you're still

940
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,700
you're still center or center minimalist

941
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,350
What smart contracts and then blockchain

942
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,490
Maximalist or minimalist

943
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,290
I'd say a few weeks ago

944
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,150
I was kind of center maximum list

945
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,190
And I'm sort of skidding back to the middle

946
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,260
Permissioned blockchain

947
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,060
I'm a little bit more

948
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:45,400
And there is some in here alone is one of your Sloan cohort that you might know

949
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,580
Six months ago when we met was working on a permissionless system

950
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,280
And now you're working on a permission system

951
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,300
You have a stored up

952
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:55,880
Yeah

953
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,620
because like you

954
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:11,410
you bounce up into the market realities and we're going to talk a lot in this course about critical thinking about when do you really need the advantage of a decentralized peer to peer system where the costs of trust or such

955
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,310
But that's the right way to go

956
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,340
But I am 1 who thinks that there's also so much economic rents in the financial system

957
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,560
That's that $1

958
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,680
5 trillion of revenues or seven and a half percent of our economy or just 200 billion in the payment systems

959
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,370
for instance

960
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,480
that there may be times that you don't really need a decentralized system

961
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:41,030
But it just might be your opportunity to tuck in underneath all those economic rents and all those revenues

962
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,040
Now

963
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,160
incumbents will react

964
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,200
You poke an incumbent commercially Pokemon

965
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,720
I mean

966
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,160
and they're going to react

967
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,080
And that's why I think blockchain may well be a catalyst for change

968
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:02,030
even if incumbents then adopt a lot of that inside the requirements of the course

969
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,650
class participation is a hard thing to judge is a faculty member

970
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,790
When I have this many people

971
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,000
but I always think class participation matters

972
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,070
We

973
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,200
we made it 30% it which

974
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,710
if you have any advice on this next semester

975
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,730
30% to 2 individual write ups

976
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,190
one in the first half

977
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,860
which is up to

978
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,180
I think

979
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,710
lecture 10

980
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,320
which is basically the blockchain fundamentals

981
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,510
You pick a topic

982
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,730
I don't care which one

983
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,220
but it's you'll get

984
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,820
you'll get a much better grade if it's about critical reasoning

985
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:48,450
If it's really taking whatever those sets of writings are and and and not just repeating that which is in the readings

986
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,220
but really going the next step and saying here's what's going on

987
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,220
And this is a business score

988
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:54,790
You don't have to

989
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,610
you know

990
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,050
convinced me that you know something about computer science

991
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,970
It's like critical reasoning about the economic opportunities

992
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,950
the strengths

993
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:05,880
the weaknesses

994
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,850
the opportunities

995
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,100
the threats that old business schools are saying of swats

996
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,090
With regard to that weeks

997
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:22,300
whether it's about hash functions early on cryptography or you sort of wait during the foundational period to permission versus permission less you

998
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,520
But to please hand it in before that class is lecture

999
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,990
because I might during the lecture say

1000
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,700
who wrote today

1001
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,560
Do you want to tell us what you think

1002
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,840
And it might help spur the class participation

1003
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:41,420
And then a second right up in the second half when we're riffing through the use cases

1004
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,050
again

1005
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,290
critical reasoning

1006
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,620
And then lastly

1007
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,860
the usual approach of teams of up to 4

1008
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,400
No

1009
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,220
I don't want teams of five

1010
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,030
I'll handle that right now

1011
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:03,250
Three or 4 just and somewhere in the second half of this semester will talk about more of the content

1012
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,110
And there's a couple of you in here that worked with me last semester in a smaller group

1013
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,230
You know

1014
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,670
I want you to do well

1015
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,730
So I'm going to sort of give you a sense of like

1016
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,660
what do we want to do

1017
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,630
But it's basically the ideas

1018
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,720
You're an entrepreneur or you're an incumbent

1019
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,380
And what sort of use case are you going to pick

1020
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,500
And and whether it's permissioned or permissionless sort of make a proposal

1021
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,960
do a use case

1022
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,790
Use your critical reasoning around this new technology

1023
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,740
Somewhere in the broad world of finance

1024
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,600
I mean

1025
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:38,770
you know

1026
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,560
and I'm glad to define finance really broad

1027
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:42,320
you know

1028
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,010
yield pick

1029
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:50,180
So that's that's kind of the piece act 1 or the fundamentals

1030
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,010
I won't go through each of the pieces

1031
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:52,400
but

1032
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:52,800
you know

1033
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,290
that's in the syllabus

1034
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,250
Of course

1035
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,930
Act 2 is the pivot of the economics

1036
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,530
And act 3

1037
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,120
our financial sector use cases

1038
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,810
And hopefully throughout we'll we'll have a lot of fun

1039
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,070
So the study questions for next Tuesday

1040
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,700
Real quick

1041
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,820
what are the roles and characteristics of money

1042
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:29,450
So I really want to sort of dig behind money is but a social construct or social convention medium of exchange store of value unit of account

1043
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,060
There's some readings about the debate

1044
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:43,390
whether money first came from the barter system or a really good set of anthropologists and archaeologists and everything say no

1045
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,900
It actually came as a ledger system and no one knows for sure

1046
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:56,720
10 and 15000 years ago whether money came from the out of the barter system or more as a unit of account keeping account of credits and ledger

1047
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,320
But I'd say when you read through some of those readings

1048
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,050
you start to think

1049
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:00,150
well

1050
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,360
this is just a societal construct

1051
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,970
And so we'll

1052
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,820
we'll get behind that

1053
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,440
What is fiat currency

1054
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,280
Fiat currency

1055
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,050
which is an invention really only of the last few hundred years

1056
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,740
And we take for granted now

1057
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,720
But how does that fit into that whole history

1058
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,660
And importantly

1059
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,920
had a ledgers

1060
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,000
accounting ledgers

1061
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,770
I know boring stuff

1062
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,300
but it's probably why we came out of the dark ages

1063
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,980
About 5 or 600 years ago with double entry bookkeeping

1064
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:30,950
Sorry

1065
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,670
I like ledgers

1066
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,880
We'll talk a little bit about ledgers and how that fits into money and securities and so forth

1067
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:48,290
And then layering in how Bitcoin fits on top of that history next Tuesday is not deeply about Bitcoin

1068
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,480
It's just a little dollop on that

1069
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,540
There will be 5 or six readings

1070
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,210
One of them is a three minute video

1071
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,070
The 3rd one

1072
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,510
it's fun watch

1073
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,360
It's just a funny little video on what money is

1074
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,960
There's no need to read Knock Moto's full paper

1075
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,270
When I said the email

1076
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,100
I mean just the cover email

1077
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,390
It's one paragraph

1078
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:11,670
My goal

1079
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:17,740
In the readings each week was not in each session was by and large try to keep less than 50 pages

1080
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,970
You say you're going to look

1081
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:19,580
Sometimes you go

1082
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,780
it looks like it's more and maybe it is

1083
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:28,640
I figure you're all going to figure out for yourself how to sort through the depth of your knowledge

1084
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:39,170
But I will predict that some of you maybe as much as a quarter or a third of you are going to go down a rabbit hole one day and you're going to be doing blockchain for the next 48 hours

1085
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:48,630
And you won't know where the time went because it is an addiction at some point that some of you will get because it's a curious notion

1086
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,610
I'm not predicting that infirmity for all of you

1087
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,420
I'm saying some of you will have that happen to you

1088
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,010
So occasionally I have readings just like a lot of you

1089
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,560
I think so

1090
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,170
Let me just conclude and then take any other questions and write up their blockchain

1091
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,370
I think

1092
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,130
does provide a peer to peer alternative

1093
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,280
I think that

1094
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,120
I hope

1095
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,520
Larry

1096
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:17,130
I'll be able to convince it does provide and that peer to peer alternative addresses

1097
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,080
cost of trust

1098
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,620
It doesn't mean it's the only way to address cost of trust

1099
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,300
But address is cost to trust

1100
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,130
The financial sector does have challenges

1101
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,790
Not just that

1102
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:33,560
It has 7 1/2 percent of our economy in the US and similar ratios around the globe

1103
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,110
But resilience

1104
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,090
How it survives

1105
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:42,890
shocks the financial crisis and things like that are are real and inclusion

1106
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,330
1

1107
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,350
7 billion people unbanked

1108
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,740
But then if you look at other products

1109
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,350
who has access to credit cards and mortgages in the like

1110
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:59,730
And then fiat currencies can rogue off and others have written a lot about the instabilities that come that fiat currencies

1111
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,890
And we'll talk about some of the history and why central banks exist and how they they came about it

1112
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,180
Next key point is we already live in an electronic age

1113
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,300
Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin didn't create it

1114
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,440
Electronic cash

1115
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,870
electronic cash

1116
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,430
I mean

1117
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,720
Sandra Bullock couldn't pay electronically

1118
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,900
That was 90 95

1119
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,600
They did a sort of B rated movie about it

1120
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,460
But by today

1121
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,960
you pay your tuition online

1122
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,910
Those of you who work get paid online

1123
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,240
You pay your auto loans online

1124
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:43,880
Most of our lives are electronic cash

1125
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,400
not 100 percent

1126
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,320
But in some countries like Sweden

1127
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,690
it's getting very close to 100%

1128
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:59,010
We'll learn together and discover that money is but a social and economic consensus

1129
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,630
Blockchain technology along the crypto finance might be a catalyst for change

1130
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,190
And then much masquerades as fact

1131
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,750
But it's only mere assertion

1132
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,430
We're going to try to sort through

1133
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,000
you know

1134
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,330
that those differences

1135
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:26,340
That doesn't mean that all of you are going to walk out agreeing with Paul Krugman and Nobel laureate or or that this is just a a bunch of nonsense

1136
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,570
The sum of you might by the but

1137
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:34,340
but I think you'll come out with real critical thinking skills

1138
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,150
And I hope that some of you will say

1139
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:47,200
I figured out actually where there's a real opportunity in the world of finance to use blockchain technology and make it a better financial sector

1140
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,036
democratizing finance or somehow providing a service at a lower cost

1141
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,170
A better service throughout

1142
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,372
I hope throughout that will learn together

1143
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:01,841
And we'll have a A bit of fun along the way

1144
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,242
So that's kind of my thoughts

1145
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:05,042
questions

1146
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,100
We have exactly what

1147
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,760
18 minutes

1148
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,510
There we go

1149
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,070
But we can cut it short too

1150
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,810
I don't care

1151
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,410
There we go

1152
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:15,890
Excuse you

1153
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,520
Tell me your name

1154
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,830
And we're gonna do placards

1155
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,620
Ryan's going to work to figure out

1156
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:19,920
you know

1157
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,660
and do placards cause it's young here

1158
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:26,120
I wonder how hard to form the final project

1159
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,450
How are the teams formed

1160
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,130
Traditionally

1161
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,720
anybody at Sloan can can speak to this too

1162
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,630
but students do it their own so that the faculty doesn't sort of try to insert themselves to help you

1163
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,220
But we

1164
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,520
we tend towards the latter half to say

1165
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:44,700
well

1166
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,400
who's formed up in in groups And when you know

1167
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,530
if it's a smaller group

1168
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:49,900
it's like

1169
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,030
well

1170
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,910
anybody is not yet formed in a team

1171
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,720
Why don't you move to the left hand side in the room and just get together

1172
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,200
But we could do that electronically

1173
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:56,630
too

1174
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,130
And you know

1175
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,840
whether Toledo and Sabrina

1176
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:00,380
who have

1177
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,260
you know

1178
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,710
good help and turn it

1179
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:08,650
basically have a social network to help form the teams because this is a big group

1180
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,240
You're right

1181
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,620
But that's traditionally people

1182
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,250
Students do it on their own

1183
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,460
Other questions

1184
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,520
Is anybody going to go out and sell their Bitcoin now or Okay

1185
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:22,860
Larry

1186
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,320
what

1187
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,440
Why are you here

1188
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,320
No

1189
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,540
no

1190
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,910
Let the payment

1191
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:31,420
she said

1192
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:33,590
No

1193
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,120
but I

1194
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,200
I'm here because I think we're gonna bring a critical skepticism to the whole field

1195
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,160
And you're incredibly informed about the finance side

1196
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,460
So I want to see the combination of those and whether at the end

1197
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,108
I'm still convinced there is a there there

1198
00:56:50,108 --> 00:57:00,360
I I am convinced that there is a there there as we've spoken because I do think it periodically change the cost of trust around the world and that will benefit developing nations

1199
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,320
But I think there's a lot of questions I still have in see how this conversation

1200
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,540
Well

1201
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,530
I thank you for coming in any week

1202
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,440
You could be here any day

1203
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,540
We benefit

1204
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,140
And I hope it's really

1205
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,870
this is meant to be a conversation

1206
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,800
I'm not that far ahead of you

1207
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,430
Simon Johnson approached me last October and said

1208
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,150
what do you think about coming up to MIT

1209
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:23,630
And Tom knows this story

1210
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,590
And and and we were sitting down for lunch in DC

1211
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,030
And it was a good time in my life

1212
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,840
My 3 girls

1213
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,790
I have three daughters

1214
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,360
and I'm a single dad

1215
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,820
And they were two were in grad school and one undergrad

1216
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,840
It was a good time in my life

1217
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,230
I said

1218
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:39,270
why not

1219
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,690
You know

1220
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:44,400
come up here and get engaged in this digital currency initiative over at the media lab

1221
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
And I've spent a life

1222
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:51,050
I was 18 years ago in sacks on the investment banking side

1223
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,380
helping people buy and sell companies called mergers and acquisitions

1224
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:56,270
And then I went to the trading side

1225
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:00,150
fixed income and went off to Asia and did a bunch of Iran

1226
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,080
The fixed incoming currency and swap trading in Asia

1227
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,440
And then my last job was the cofinance officer

1228
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,820
So we were about a quarter of a trillion dollar balance sheet at that time

1229
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,920
The gohman sacks

1230
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,210
This is we were so private

1231
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,010
which meant if we lost money

1232
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,280
we were personally

1233
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,620
I was a general partner was caput

1234
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,800
That's a technical word

1235
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:24,810
And but we had

1236
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:31,680
we had 700 legal entities and 1000 people who could commit the capital of the firm

1237
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,630
Those are people

1238
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,010
We generally called traders

1239
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:36,690
But

1240
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:36,940
you know

1241
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,800
as a fascinating period of time

1242
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:45,250
I then went on to public service because Bob Rubin knew that I'd be a soft touch to service

1243
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,960
He was the treasury secretary

1244
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,300
I was a former partner at Goldman Sachs

1245
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,280
And I went off to the US Treasury as assistant secretary and under sector in the late 90s

1246
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,530
little different times than we have now for many reasons

1247
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,860
But we were paying down the debt

1248
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,600
We were dealing with the Asian debt crisis

1249
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,480
long term capital management

1250
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,030
that Russian debt crisis

1251
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,460
It was sort of a fascinating period of time

1252
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,020
I worked on a bill with John McCain

1253
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,730
I didn't get to know Senator McCain that well

1254
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,580
But it was just remarkable to work with

1255
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,570
even for a short period of time called E signature

1256
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,120
It was a bill that basically said you could sign everything electronically

1257
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,570
And he was the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee at the time

1258
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,340
It was wonderful

1259
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,310
It's a little sometimes in government

1260
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:30,970
you can work

1261
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,270
work on small things

1262
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,260
I worked on the redesign of the currency

1263
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:41,000
And I could tell you stories about why it looks the way it does and how you can redesign paper currency

1264
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,360
And for a future lecture

1265
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:51,800
I'll tell you the one design feature that I is still in the currency and you can visually see it because and and when I asked for it

1266
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,980
the fellow that ran the Bureau of Engraving said why

1267
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,380
And I said

1268
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,460
because it looks better

1269
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,460
And I'm the guy that's approving it

1270
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,040
And maybe could we get it done because we worked this out and it did look better

1271
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:02,890
And he loved it

1272
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,410
He was worried about the political risk of doing it

1273
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,020
It was a better design

1274
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,350
You just

1275
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,260
I said I'll cover you politically

1276
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,620
Let's do it

1277
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,480
But then I worked with Paul Sarbanes

1278
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,420
What became Sarbanes Oxley

1279
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,270
I was a senior adviser

1280
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:19,870
I worked and kicked around some political campaigns

1281
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,910
We lost two of them

1282
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,940
That would be the O 8 Hillary campaign and the 16 Hillary campaign

1283
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,900
I was her chief financial officer

1284
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,990
I was in OA to senior advisor doing economic policy and outreach and handholding

1285
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,210
And oh gosh

1286
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:39,717
and And then in the middle of those two campaigns

1287
01:00:39,717 --> 01:00:44,338
I read something called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission

1288
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:45,878
which was postcrisis

1289
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:50,242
What do we do with this is a real public policy shortcoming

1290
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:53,322
And I looked at as an opportunity to

1291
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:53,579
to

1292
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:54,349
as I said

1293
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:57,430
democratize finance a bit and lower risk

1294
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,180
And so we tried to bring transparency to a 3 or $400 trillion market caught swaps

1295
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,230
which are just contracts for transference of risk

1296
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,758
And they are a form of derivative that that that we're unregulated

1297
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:16,050
And we were trying to bring transparency to that and lower risk through central clearing

1298
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,260
So that's sort of my professional life

1299
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:20,810
And as I said

1300
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,994
I got three daughters and they were well situated

1301
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:25,008
So when Simon said

1302
01:01:25,008 --> 01:01:25,617
come on up

1303
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:26,022
I said

1304
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:26,428
great

1305
01:01:26,428 --> 01:01:27,240
And I love MIT

1306
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,254
It's just terrific

1307
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:28,660
terrific

1308
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,400
And and you all are great

1309
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,980
Unless there's other questions I'm going to let you go early

1310
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:35,280
I don't

1311
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:35,660
you know

1312
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,050
I don't
