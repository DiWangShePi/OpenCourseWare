00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,700
So today what we're going to be doing is

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,570
Last week, you gave us some feedback

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,410
What you wanted to do in the class

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,060
We're gonna go through that and talk about the readings

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm going to do a little calling on you

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,130
and helping you take the class through the readings

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,140
and then the 6 or 7 things I'm going to do： history of money

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,190
ledgers

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,310
fiat currency

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,190
central banks and credit cards

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,690
and the role of money

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,970
Some early digital money

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,670
You had the Clark reading as to a bunch of failed attempts

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,000
Just all the way through a little bit of mobile money

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,820
All the way up to Starbucks and ali pay and yet the riddle remains

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,750
We're going to get really deep into Bitcoin in the next three classes

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,830
But this is to give some foundational bits of money and ledgers and central banking and technology

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,050
And then of course

23
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,770
I always like to finish the class talking a little bit about why we're doing what we're doing between now and then

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,770
even though the readings are required

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,750
I know you're all busy

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,400
I know that you've all got a bunch of classes and

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,990
like good business students and business people, you optimize

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,750
So I'm trying to give you a sense of why you might read it

29
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,290
Rather than it's required at the end of each class

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,520
and how it fits into the coarse narrative

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,720
And then we'll do a little bit of conclusions

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,090
So the survey results

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,250
What did you want to learn

34
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,680
This is really your class

35
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,180
And I'm going to learn as much from you

36
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,440
But hopefully we're going to cover what you want

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,530
So here's a list of those things who are at least written by two of you

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,360
First was technical things

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,510
18 of you said understanding blockchain technology

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,230
Hopefully we get to that

41
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,470
But you might find that you'll want to do more after this class

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,918
The ecosystem and being able to have an educated discussion

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,320
sort of the dinner party conversation around blockchain

44
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,720
I think will be successful

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,400
But at the end of the semester

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,980
we're going to pull these slides up again

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,700
and we'll see how we did as a group

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,370
You all talked a lot about applications

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,230
How can you actually apply it

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,771
Learning it in the venture space

51
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,850
and thinking about where it really works in the world

52
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,970
And I think we're going to spend a lot of time on that in the second half

53
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,900
But all throughout

54
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,240
we're going to be talking about the economics

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,750
And what's the reality versus the hype

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,480
You also wanted to understand its impact

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,890
on people's lives

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,620
The regulation

59
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,960
About 6 of you said something about regulation

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm glad because we're only doing one lecture on that

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,428
but we're going to spread it out because as we talked about in our first class

62
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,673
and I'm honored Larry's here again

63
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:18,164
But we're going to always be thinking about Larry's four ways

64
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,410
And I see -- is it Jihee?

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,910
Where are Larry Lessig's

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,160
Yeah, you shook your head

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,970
Yes, so

68
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,010
I know

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,430
It is code and architecture, market, law, and norms

70
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,380
You got it

71
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,560
Does anybody want to say how that relates to blockchain

72
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,780
Why we're chatting about that

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,250
Oh my God

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm going to have to cold call fast, right

75
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,450
You are from R3

76
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,652
Joe? -- Yeah

77
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:57,480
No, I remember we saw it last class

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,450
but I can't relate it now to blockchain

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,180
Can you relate to anything in life

80
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,053
Maybe not.  Alan

81
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:07,675
Help your your table made out

82
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm waiting for my moment to shine

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,920
This isn't it? -- This isn't it

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,140
I'm having fun you know

85
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,460
this is what I'm going to do

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,170
I'm just gonna have

87
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,300
it's don't worry about it. Ha

88
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,850
so why do markets, code, law

89
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,820
Did, did I hear

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,390
Did I? I can't see your name

91
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,320
but is it Dar?

92
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,540
Yeah

93
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,050
why

94
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,600
Why is that relate to all this

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,340
Can you repeat the question?

96
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,000
Jihee

97
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,420
you're going to repeat the question cause you went through it

98
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,830
So how does Larry's four forces relate to

99
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,739
our topic of blockchains

100
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:52,600
And the four forces, again, are market

101
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,780
So business, law, code or architecture

102
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,760
Call it technology and social norms

103
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,789
So I think it's because it brings like a new way

104
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:11,350
of doing those things like a new tool in order to-- so

105
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,960
what I got from the reading is like, these ledgers already existed

106
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,480
but given that now we have, like big data

107
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,660
for example,  then like more things going on helps our society

108
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,270
roll it out better.

109
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,840
Good way to say

110
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,430
look it's unfair of me

111
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,590
It wasn't one of the readings

112
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,610
I'm just saying in everything in life

113
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,930
I find these things grind up against each other

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,210
I spent a lot of time in Washington in politics

115
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,159
But the markets and how the commercial enterprise

116
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,663
and the economy grinds up against technology

117
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:50,720
and sort of grinds up against the law

118
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,490
And then of course

119
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,560
just social normative behavior

120
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,440
These four forces in almost everything one does in life

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,600
you will find

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,678
And so I just ask you to always

123
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,546
whether it's one reading or another reading

124
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:06,560
bring that to your thought process of this class

125
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm not going to assign Larry's assignment

126
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,390
I didn't know he was even going to be here

127
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,110
But I've always thought these, it's a good discipline to think

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,280
Okay what are the commercial realities

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,350
The markets

130
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,500
What's the technology

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,433
Even if it's in an earlier day

132
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:27,030
and it's a technology of the car replacing the horse and carriage

133
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:32,509
How does government or the official sector

134
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,820
put it into a set of standards that are required

135
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,460
And then how do we as society

136
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,864
even if it's not required just to have our behaviors

137
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,049
those are the four forces

138
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,020
So that's why

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,670
and I probably just failed Larry's class

140
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,770
But that's how I thought about it

141
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,470
I did probably right

142
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,460
And now he's

143
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,530
he's shaking his head

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,450
But regulation is just one of those four forces

145
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,250
And that's why I pause there

146
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,920
And so we'll have it in every class

147
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,340
But only one lecture

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,460
Money and markets

149
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,960
That's one of the other forces

150
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,550
Five of you said you want to make money

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,870
And I applaud those who said that because, why won't they?

152
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,500
You're in a business school

153
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,170
Why not

154
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,270
But investing in trends

155
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,400
Now, there was a bunch of other miscellaneous topics

156
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm not going to go through them

157
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,158
I kind of thought the last two were interesting

158
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,170
anecdotes from my past

159
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,830
I'm not sure who said that

160
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,140
I'm not sure what you want to know about, my three daughters

161
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,690
my running or this you know

162
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,940
Wall Street stuff and finance

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,580
And I'd like to understand hyperbitcoinization as well

164
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,670
But I don't know who asks that question

165
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,310
I don't know what it is

166
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,848
So I'll try to figure out what hyper...

167
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:48,580
does anyone want to own up to that question? They were anonymous

168
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,140
All right

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,350
All right

170
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,160
So today's study questions

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,200
What's the role of money historically

172
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,430
and in today's digital economy

173
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,760
And this is what I'm going to look for discussion

174
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,180
So is anybody who want to tell me what the role of money

175
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,040
what would be your answer to this? Anton?

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,430
Umm.. The

177
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,060
The medium of the transaction and enn

178
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,520
and the unit of... like a counting unit

179
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:25,380
And also, like the state of the value.

180
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,500
So the three classic rolls of money that people talk about.

181
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,460
Kelly, you want to repeat what he just said

182
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,619
That was quite a question, but I think historically

183
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:39,215
it was pay off debts, starting, you know

184
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:41,810
and conquering various lands awards

185
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,740
and then also funding trade wars, cutting taxes

186
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
So a lot of societal things that drove civilization forward

187
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,116
And what we'll discuss today and

188
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,820
what it is is that money is a social construct

189
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,100
It's something that societies came together

190
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,457
whether it's hard to tell whether it was 5000 years ago

191
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,040
or 8,000 or 10,000 years ago, that it's really

192
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,740
it's a social consensus mechanism

193
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,050
But we're going to chat about the readings in a minute

194
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,540
and come back to that question

195
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,690
What is fiat currency

196
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,780
Is anybody wanna... Tom

197
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
You want to tell us what fiat currency is

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,570
Umm

199
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,200
It's a shame, tom

200
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,500
See I recognize you

201
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,330
So it's... -- My website

202
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:30,787
So this is like a established currency

203
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:34,740
by a central publishing item and a market

204
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,630
Right, so you said it's a central currency and it's by government

205
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,820
Anybody else want to add some things

206
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,350
Is it Kyle?

207
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,620
I would just add that it's not backed by any physical commodity

208
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,520
So it's not backed by any physical commodity

209
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,360
Yeah. Really just the good faith

210
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,810
and credit of the nation that issues it

211
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,277
Daniel, did you want to add anything

212
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:01,520
I just want to say somewhere that it's not gold backed or anything like that.

213
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,900
But was it always that way

214
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,260
It wasn't originally that way

215
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,210
A fiat currency might be backed by something physical

216
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,950
Was there other

217
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,310
Remind me your name

218
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,110
I'm sorry...  -- Josh  -- Josh

219
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,670
I mean specifically

220
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,450
we used to settle debts

221
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,300
And specifically those to the government

222
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,940
So taxes

223
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
All right so for me is for taxes

224
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,250
And remind me your name

225
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,430
Cause I can't see a card

226
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,430
What ? --Sean --Sean

227
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,600
So basically, there's no inherent value in fiat currency

228
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,410
So, so basically, there's no one recognize

229
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,540
that specific currency itself. There's no government

230
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,500
So here is a question for the class

231
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,580
Is there inherent value to non fiat currencies

232
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,699
Because Sean saying that maybe a distinguishing

233
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,430
characteristic of fiat is it has no inherent value

234
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,623
Terry -- Terry

235
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:56,167
Well actually

236
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:02,033
the same applies to any commodity that's used to as..., the back

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,503
currency in general

238
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:10,678
because it's just the scarcity of some specific resource and the social

239
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:15,310
common agreement that that's going to be the  parameter

240
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,570
So, how many people or more in line with Eric

241
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,890
Or there's not one

242
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,780
right answer to this

243
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,670
This is this is a question that's been debated for decades or centuries

244
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,260
But, how many are more on Shawn's camp that...

245
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,890
Well I think it depends that for example

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,530
gold is definitely like a social construct

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,420
We decide that as a human society

248
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,960
the goal is going to be something valuable

249
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,250
But like if it's like

250
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,590
you know

251
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,350
grains that humans can eat

252
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,790
And you know that I think have the inherent values

253
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,560
So I think there are non-hierarchical currencies that does have inherent values

254
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,210
And that does not have inherent values

255
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,380
Anybody

256
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,980
And what's your... Jihee, yeah

257
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,400
Tom

258
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,080
Tomas？-- Tomas

259
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,020
I just want to say that

260
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,350
the characters there is another component

261
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,184
which, the fact that it is a legal thing for development

262
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:10,172
in some, in some counties

263
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,658
forced the society to use the

264
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,646
the currency which makes

265
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:18,126
more comfortable for people to use as a...

266
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:22,750
Also Tomas is saying that fiat currency is legal tender

267
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,294
So first we have to discuss what is legal tender

268
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:29,290
is anybody want to knock that one out of the ballpark

269
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,150
who hasn't raised their hand yet now

270
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,500
All right

271
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,220
Well I think that's maybe my earlier comment

272
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,320
It can be used to settle debts and enn...

273
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,525
and specifically

274
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,687
specifically those to the government

275
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,455
So you can use gold as a money

276
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,223
It can be a store of value

277
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,188
It can be a means of exchange

278
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:52,350
but you can't pay your taxes in gold right

279
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,086
Or is that correct

280
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,212
So 19th century

281
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:59,995
could you pay your taxes in gold in the US and in Britain

282
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:03,090
in other countries that had gold currency

283
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,550
Is it just a yes or no

284
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,000
But James

285
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,882
It's yes, but up to 1970s

286
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,366
the gold the currency

287
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,758
the paper currency is attached to the gold standard

288
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:15,606
So inherently

289
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:21,118
there is an exchange of value that is pegged by the government or bank or the central bank

290
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:25,782
So it's almost one of the same thing at the at that time until more recent years

291
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:28,962
James is saying you could use gold as legal tender

292
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,234
legal tender, again

293
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:34,050
is something that a society comes together and creates a law

294
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,100
You know back to the Lessig four

295
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,970
that's a... you know society together

296
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,760
It says it's not just a social normative behavior

297
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,520
it's a law

298
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,030
One must accept this in the US and the UK In many countries

299
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,850
it says for all debts

300
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,860
public and private

301
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,130
So a debt to the government or a debt in a store

302
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,330
We're going to get to later as to when is it true that somebody has to take your cash

303
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,858
But I'm going to hold off on that in a minute

304
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,004
And talk about it

305
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,613
But I think also Jihee

306
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:15,137
said it was somewhere between Sean and Eric

307
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,704
Both physically in the class

308
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:20,272
And in terms of her articulation that

309
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:25,150
fiat currency might not have anything inherently behind it

310
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,650
And but gold mostly doesn't have anything inherently behind it

311
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,520
And then some forms of currency like grain

312
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,910
had more

313
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,710
So maybe it's a continuum

314
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,470
Maybe it's not, you know

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,700
black and white

316
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,800
100% or 0%

317
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,230
And then we're going to talk a little bit about how Bitcoin fits into it

318
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,610
And our next three classes are going to be really into the technology of Bitcoin

319
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,270
but just just a little bit of teasing out before I go through some lecture slides

320
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,410
Who wants to talk about how Bitcoin might fit into this history of money

321
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,820
And then I'm going to return to that question in about 45 minutes and ask you again

322
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,510
But does anybody want to say from the readings and if you remind me your name

323
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,040
Isabelle -- Isabel.

324
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,790
So with Bitcoin is kind of the same where the value is given by society

325
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,070
except with Bitcoin

326
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,900
it's not backed by any kind of central bank

327
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,490
So people don't think that there is an inherent value

328
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,250
but it like

329
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,273
but the readings pointed out that

330
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:27,000
they're sort of that same history, except it doesn't have...

331
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,812
So Isabel was saying that Bitcoin fits

332
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,547
into the history of money because

333
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:35,500
like fiat currencies and like Jihee said about gold

334
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,230
it doesn't necessarily have any inherent monetary value

335
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,350
but it's a societal set of norms that people are accepting it as having value

336
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,450
But the key distinction that Isabel said was that it's no central

337
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,001
It's not backed by any kind of central bank

338
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,530
It's not backed by a central bank or a central authority

339
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,280
Alan?

340
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,841
Yes, so bitcoin,  in my opinion, is unique

341
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:03,290
because I think the value of bitcoin changes over time

342
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,270
not the fluctuation that we see like $6000 or $19000

343
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,440
but in terms of the power for the utility of the point itself

344
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,600
And, so today, for example

345
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,370
we might be able to buy pizza

346
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,710
or coffee or whatever with Bitcoin

347
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,210
So there is an inherent value in terms of minimum exchange

348
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,840
And it will change as society adopts it more and more

349
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,410
So I think it's hard to define if there is an inherent folly or not

350
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,690
So Alan is raising that Bitcoin

351
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,444
If I can put some words in your mouth

352
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:36,879
and tell me if I'm correct

353
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,149
that Bitcoin might have some distinguishing features

354
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:45,730
from even fiat currency that its value is shifting over time with adoption

355
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,140
And is that, I mean

356
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,350
you didn't use that word

357
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,550
Please let me know your name again

358
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,220
Brotish

359
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,200
right, like British

360
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,850
but with an o

361
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,710
you told me earlier

362
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,060
Brotish

363
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,890
So I think

364
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,938
Another way is thinking of the thing that is is the evolution of the ledger technology

365
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:10,901
like accounting and the evolution of money along with it

366
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:14,155
So initially that we saw in the reading the

367
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:16,618
how it happened in the previous four occasions

368
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,784
And at the end of the three layers and then distributed layer

369
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:24,964
which is kind of the fundamental, four of the fundamental blocks of bitcoin -- Right

370
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:30,130
so that is another way of kind of a natural progression of how money evolved

371
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,505
So, Brotish?

372
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,091
Yeah

373
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:36,872
So what brotish is raised is also Bitcoin fits into the history of ledgers

374
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:41,343
whether it's double entry ledgers as recognized through tea accounts

375
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:47,450
or other forms of ledgers that it adds to this whole long history of ledgers

376
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,652
I agree with that

377
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,422
And it's a new form of keeping ledgers, Elan

378
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:56,702
So Bitcoin is also similar to gold

379
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,460
There is an element of scarcity

380
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,856
Of scarcity

381
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:00,400
Yeah

382
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,999
So we cannot generate that many Bitcoin -- Correct

383
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,235
and only generate Bitcoin every 10 minutes

384
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:08,460
keeps happening every four years

385
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,390
So scarcity

386
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,980
it seems like scarcity and ledgers are important components of ... Viva

387
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,197
So it does have a fixed demand

388
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,095
Like, umm sorry, a fixed supply

389
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:19,728
like you said

390
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,204
in terms of scarcity

391
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:22,680
but the more we adopt it

392
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,632
the more it becomes divisible in terms of units

393
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,530
And so we can increase its use

394
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,620
Because now you can divide, you know

395
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,494
you can divide them up to

396
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:35,644
This is good. So divisibility is another characteristic of money

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,233
Scarcity

398
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,140
Adoption as Alan said

399
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,970
Ledgers

400
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,371
Sorry, Tomas

401
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,240
We mention decentralization

402
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,130
because this implementation

403
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,413
make feasible the Bitcoin and makes feasible

404
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:55,017
to implement this kind of thing in the decentralized environment

405
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:58,366
So without any central power to do

406
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:03,360
define or dictate the supply and other aspects of the concept

407
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,990
I will take one more

408
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,790
and then I'll start to talk about history

409
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,410
Why don't we go here to remind me your name

410
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,000
Alexis -- Alexis

411
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,290
...money and like other forms of currency

412
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,120
Even if it's not controlled by like central government or central bank

413
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,130
like there is no fixed exchange rate fluctuate extremely quickly

414
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,820
We have other type of appearances

415
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,300
So I mean

416
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
it's still very different

417
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,460
So, Alexis

418
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,400
if I understand Alexis's point is that there is no fixed exchange rate

419
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,890
About Bitcoin we're talking about

420
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,560
but couldn't we really broaden that to all forms of currency

421
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,830
I mean

422
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,580
what really is the exchange rate between an ounce of gold and a bushel of corn

423
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes and no

424
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,000
I mean yes

425
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,180
but like for example

426
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,270
like some state do control

427
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,000
stainless steel with other tenants

428
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,050
Alright good point

429
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,040
So Alexis is saying yes and no

430
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,080
because some governments try to fix

431
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,870
Now back to markets

432
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,630
How well has that worked when governments try to fix an exchange rate

433
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,760
I mean just a sense of the class

434
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,490
Does that work well

435
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,705
so it sort of might work well in temporal short periods

436
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:26,890
works less well for you know decades on end

437
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,540
I'll take one more, and then I'm just

438
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,778
I want to go through a couple...

439
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,381
Just one comment. That way you can teach hours of work

440
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:37,114
That's how economies define it previously, right

441
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:39,607
But I just want to ask

442
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,020
what is a ledger?

443
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,810
What is a ledger

444
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,030
Very good question

445
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm gonna be chatting of it that in a minute

446
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,320
But does anybody wanna

447
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,090
hit that

448
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:53,644
I'm sorry

449
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,994
No, over here

450
00:20:54,994 --> 00:21:00,842
...It's just a numerical record of everything recorded, in a fashion

451
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,641
So it's... -- A numerical record

452
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,890
I think that's a good thing

453
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,590
A ledger is basically a way to record

454
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:16,210
Economic activity or social relationships or financial relationships

455
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,330
I would say it's both a way to record economic activity

456
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,050
And it's a system of recording financial relationships

457
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,372
And while I didn't assign these readings

458
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:35,277
some very good academic research suggests that the first

459
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:39,315
methods of writing and symbols of writing had to do with

460
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:44,740
numbers and had to do with ledgers rather than words and communication

461
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,125
Because it's so fundamental to society to record

462
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:57,600
various economic transactions or to record the financial relationships amongst

463
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,890
between members of a community

464
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,872
whether it was a small village or when society burst out of villages

465
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:07,010
thousands of years ago. Is that help?

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,212
We'll be back to it

467
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:14,050
and better that you ask that here than in your accounting fundamentals class

468
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,110
I don't know

469
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,622
So the readings we've sort of talked about the readings

470
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,080
have any of you actually watched the little 3 minute video

471
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,710
did you

472
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,360
what do you think? Just, I mean, just as a...

473
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,420
I'm sorry, here, we haven't chatted yet

474
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,768
I think the blog based principle was

475
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,250
that any currency or anything for that matter

476
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,214
has value equivalent to what the socity assigns to it

477
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:38,616
Right

478
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,976
Because the video basically just showed the guy

479
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:44,843
who created his own galaxy and was just selling into the public

480
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:47,583
And his whole claim was that it is real if you believe it is real

481
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,484
Right,  so it was just

482
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,386
it was a nice little ditty, in a way

483
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:51,253
Matthew, I'm sorry?

484
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,654
I would have given him $1 for it

485
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,590
You would have given him $1? Great

486
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,892
Seeing how much the pizzas went for

487
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,300
You know... -- Who knows

488
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,780
Would anybody else have given him a dollar for it

489
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,164
No, maybe

490
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,901
Oh, oh. But you would have

491
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:04,150
Yeah

492
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,318
I actually

493
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,540
I am working with local currencies

494
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,605
It is kind of the same

495
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:10,715
but they are just

496
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,935
you can use it just locally

497
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:17,713
And I mean, it keeps the money inside the community

498
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:20,150
that decides to use that way of transaction

499
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,730
We're going to refer back to each of these ratings as we go through the next 45 minutes

500
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,320
But yeah

501
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,723
I was wondering if he was actually breaking the law

502
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:30,670
by launching his own competing currency for the US dollar?

503
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,820
Is that a legitimate-- Obviously, it didn't compete with the US dollar

504
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,250
but... -- You know

505
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,490
you raised a very good question

506
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,970
I'm not aware of any statute federal or state

507
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,177
that says there's an absolute monopoly

508
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,340
or in forms of currency as there is and other things

509
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,940
like you know

510
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,230
that slot in the door

511
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,350
that's called the where you can put a letter through the door or a mailbox

512
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,230
There's actually a law that says that the US Postal Service has a monopoly

513
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,030
And that's why UPS

514
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,080
is not allowed to put their boxes or anything in there

515
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,860
There is a government fiat monopoly

516
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,120
but you raise a very good question

517
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,108
what we've found in the last 10 years with Bitcoin

518
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:23,712
without with really oversimplifying is

519
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:28,884
that it is legal to create your own form of money

520
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:33,050
as Bitcoin is possibly this money

521
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,325
But you have to comply with all the other laws

522
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:40,310
and all those other laws that we'll talk about in other lectures in essence

523
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,130
fall into buckets of guarding against illicit activity

524
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,300
So the bank secrecy act and all the laws related to any money laundering and terrorism

525
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,630
finance and so forth

526
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,307
That one still has to pay your taxes

527
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:55,844
if you're gaining or losing on this investment

528
00:24:55,844 --> 00:25:01,283
that the Federal Reserve and other authorities around the globe still

529
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,310
want to ensure for financial stability

530
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,880
the fellow on the streets of

531
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,560
I don't remember what city New York selling his dollars when Matthew bought it for a dollar

532
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,200
And I think over here, Brianna?

533
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,400
What's that -- My name?

534
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,610
Yes

535
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,320
Priscilla, bought it

536
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,290
It's probably we're going to have the society is still going to be stable

537
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,770
It's gonna be alright

538
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,580
But if millions of people were buying it then people might worry

539
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,947
And then there's the third big bucket that

540
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,180
we look at as investor and consumer protection

541
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,950
But I think it's allowed

542
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,170
So we'll refer to these, Joaquin

543
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:39,970
and then I'm gonna go on

544
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,230
Can you legally pay

545
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,300
for example, salaries

546
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,680
in bitcoin in the US ?

547
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:53,270
Yes, and why is it that you can legally pay for wages in Bitcoin in the US

548
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,610
So anybody

549
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,830
I know it's outside of the readings

550
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,180
but why do you think it is allowed in this society

551
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,390
Is it, Kyle

552
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,850
Wouldn't those compensation phones be allowed under a new contract

553
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,300
So, most things you could pay somebody in these placards

554
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,391
I doubt really that you're going to value of that much

555
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,976
but you could pay somebody in this

556
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:24,336
You could pay somebody in gold, euros, bitcoin

557
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:26,921
And there are firms that are pegged

558
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:30,540
Usually they are developing blockchain applications

559
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,070
And interestingly

560
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,179
they have to compute the value of the wages

561
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,281
to do withholding taxes

562
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:42,890
because the US government will not accept taxes in Bitcoin

563
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,340
So they figure out the fair market value

564
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,440
And there are companies in the US that pay people in Bitcoin

565
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,900
who are doing development work around blockchain applications

566
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,560
But the taxes need to be computed and analyzed and then paid in US dollars because

567
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,206
and there was a legislative initiative in Arizona

568
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,442
earlier this year where a state legislature wanted to

569
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:11,830
have Arizona be the first state in the land to accept Bitcoin for taxes

570
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,690
but it failed in committee

571
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,330
It didn't even get a full vote of it

572
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,920
I can't remember

573
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,860
It was the Arizona Senate or the Arizona House of Delegates

574
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,010
but, so just a little walk through the history

575
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,530
I was going to do a little history of money and have some fun

576
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,480
So in Ethiopia

577
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
people put together salt bars

578
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,150
This is not that long ago

579
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,470
Salt, as Jihei have said earlier

580
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,470
is really valuable in society

581
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,740
And they standardize the shape and size and said

582
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,330
here is salt bars

583
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,190
We're going to get to a little bit later

584
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,330
All the characteristics of money

585
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,580
But what else do you think

586
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,360
A salt bar in Ethiopia

587
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,370
as opposed to maybe some other country

588
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,228
What did it have as well as to why people might use that

589
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,020
Oil -- What's that?

590
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,390
Crude oil -- Crude oil, all right

591
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,450
I hadn't thought of that

592
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,250
I'm going to keep thinking about that

593
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,480
It's not a, it's not a common characteristic of money

594
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,060
But why salt bars? what else might it have in Ethiopia

595
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,890
Are you gonna say that

596
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,590
You can use salt to preserve or... -- You can preserve food

597
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,640
But because it was mined

598
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,550
there was some scarcity as well as and a lot of currencies

599
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,540
a lot of moneys over time have that fundamental issue

600
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,540
Cowie shells from West Africa

601
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,001
Does anyone know the history of when Cowie shells

602
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:44,570
got really debased and stopped being used from the readings

603
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,490
I can't remember that was in the readings or not

604
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,330
They got debased when Europeans started to realize that they were accepted as a value

605
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,770
And it was a very sad and terrible history too

606
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,180
because it's related to the whole slave trade

607
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,760
but that the Europeans could figure out that societies accepted

608
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,240
This is something of value

609
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,598
But they also debase that currency

610
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:12,480
and they debase the land and capture people as slaves

611
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,210
I mean, it was a quite a collection of not particularly good things going on

612
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,530
Talley sticks in England

613
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,511
So anybody from the readings

614
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,379
because there was a little bit of the debate

615
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,982
in the first reading about the history of money

616
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:32,053
and wanna chat and I'll pull up the rye stones for me

617
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:37,125
how this fits into that first reading and the debate between

618
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,740
has the money come from a history of border

619
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,640
Or did money come from a history of ledgers and credit

620
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,050
which is kind of a setup of that first

621
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,420
I think the first reading

622
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,600
Any thoughts

623
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Which ones are these

624
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,110
These four bits of money

625
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,420
Early money or more about maybe border

626
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:08,020
So there are two... two theory, right

627
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,670
That which corresponds to this one

628
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,295
And it was a way to measure that

629
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:13,730
Which one?

630
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,440
The sticks -- The sticks

631
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,730
The tally sticks, yes,  correct

632
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,290
Which is the second one on here that has to do with debts actually

633
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,850
And credits -- The stones

634
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,770
The stone, the Rai stones

635
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,720
So it's remarkable

636
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,810
The Rai stones were so that on this island of Yap

637
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,570
they couldn't possibly lug it around and use it

638
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,900
You know, in traditional medium of exchange

639
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,780
but it was viewed as, well

640
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,290
I have 1/6 of this bride's stone

641
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,520
You have 1/16

642
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,400
And then if I make an exchange

643
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,630
we'd remember

644
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,130
And the society was small enough to keep a form of ledgers

645
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,790
even to the extent that when a Rai stone was lost in a river

646
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,250
they said, you know, the river Rai stone

647
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,380
we each have this piece

648
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,870
So on the island of Yap

649
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,440
I can assure you these stones could not be used for anything else

650
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Does anyone know

651
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,360
Because it was outside the readings

652
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,480
What made these stones so scarce

653
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:20,740
So Rai stones required on an island about 200 km away from the app

654
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,810
So were they exceedingly hard to get, like gold

655
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,380
Like mining of gold

656
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,730
What else's mind these days

657
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,972
That might be a money

658
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,080
Lithium

659
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,620
What's that?

660
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,860
Can I hear everybody

661
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm saying lithium

662
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,370
What's that

663
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,560
The batteries... for batteries, is gonna be

664
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,385
very difficult in the future for electric batteries and whatnot

665
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,740
And what is mind right now

666
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,454
That's at the center of this class

667
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:48,530
Bitcoin -- Bitcoin, right

668
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,760
The Yap stone was, in essence,  quarried

669
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,310
a couple of hundred kilometers away

670
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,230
And what debased that currency was when sailors from England came

671
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,470
there's a specific sailor

672
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,090
I think his name was O'keefe in the late 19th century

673
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,200
And he realized that these stones were valuable

674
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,710
And he went to the other island

675
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,210
and he started quarrying and came back and forth

676
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,450
And within a few years

677
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,150
the whole economic system collapsed

678
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,210
We moved to metal money

679
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,820
At first

680
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,290
it wasn't really stamped

681
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,170
It was just heavy

682
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,680
It was hard to quarry bronze in Rome

683
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,140
There's some China's in Sweden

684
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,640
These were starting to be stamped by the official sector

685
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,399
And then we had minted money

686
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,490
starting somewhere around 2500 years ago

687
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,610
And there's debates as to whether it started in Greece or in China

688
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,060
And but

689
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,980
but where an official emblem was placed upon a scarce resource that was used

690
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,860
Paper money came along in a sense

691
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,080
for what reason?

692
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,840
Why, why did

693
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,850
why did society first tip into paper money

694
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,560
Cause there's not enough gold to back it up

695
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,780
I mean, like because there's

696
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,430
One reason

697
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,810
Not enough gold

698
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,990
I'm sorry, I haven't

699
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,430
I think it's just easy to... -- Easy to use

700
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,720
It's kind of heavy

701
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,820
especially if there wasn't gold

702
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,970
And if it was copper bronze

703
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,990
it was just heavy

704
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,130
Or if it was wheat

705
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,180
you have to put it in a storage unit

706
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,060
So the first paper money's from China were basically warehouse receipts

707
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,490
And I spent five years running something called commodity Futures trading Commission

708
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,510
And so I guess I learned a lot about warehouse receipts, commodity receipts

709
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,870
where you put a commodity in a warehouse

710
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,420
And then you got a piece of paper that said

711
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,360
yes, you have that commodity there

712
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,443
So the first paper moneys were basically warehouse receipts in China

713
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:53,060
because whatever it was, grain or gold

714
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,130
And then you had a piece of paper backing it

715
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,100
These are £5 notes from England and the continental notes in the US

716
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,890
But between so that that note in China is about 700 years old

717
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,220
But before between that first paper money and the 18th century

718
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,724
Who do you think we're kind of the first bankers in the 7th

719
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:17,076
late 17th century, early 18th century

720
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:21,520
Who were, what craft had they been in before they were in banking

721
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,648
--Trading...  --Alpha --International trading

722
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,800
International trade

723
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,590
They actually did something more local

724
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,261
I talked... just talked about this

725
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:39,027
like the ones that have lands and all the...

726
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,397
the ones that have lands and all the...

727
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:45,371
Lanes? -- Lands...

728
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:49,270
Land. Land. No, they had something else that they were doing

729
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,280
Tom? -- Printmakers --They were printmakers

730
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,550
I like that

731
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,720
We're not there yet

732
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,945
Money lenders?

733
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,779
What's that?

734
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:59,080
They're underwriting insurance

735
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,710
A little bit later

736
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,440
They were doing agriculture?

737
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,310
It's definitely outside of the reading

738
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,740
They're goldsmiths

739
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,110
The... Some of the first dominant bankers in London

740
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,920
They were small goldsmiths and they took the gold

741
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,820
They gave you a piece of paper

742
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,440
And then they went from there

743
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,210
And then all of a sudden

744
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,260
they figured out how to do credit

745
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,110
Later in the semester

746
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,940
we're going to talk about Bitcoin credit

747
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,130
It's not there yet, by the way

748
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,260
I think in the next 18 to 36 months

749
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,300
we're going to start seeing crypto lending and crypto finance in the form

750
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,760
similar to what the goldsmiths were doing in the early 17 hundreds in England

751
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,640
Nolan

752
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,380
Is that scalable with the finite number of frequent

753
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,270
in your opinion

754
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,640
So very good question

755
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,650
Is it scalable to land against a finite currency

756
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:59,870
I think so

757
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,140
but it's not

758
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,210
it's not done yet

759
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,840
right

760
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,490
Yeah

761
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,220
because when you

762
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,130
when you run money to someone

763
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,120
I guess it couldn't be in the form of a Bitcoin

764
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,410
but you can lend someone dollars

765
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,540
they could redeem in bitcoin

766
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,250
You'd be increasing kind of the
money supply

767
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,460
So you don't need

768
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,700
you're not moving money around directions

769
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,940
So this is exactly the central of commercial banking today

770
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,530
It's called fractional banking, we will be talking about that in a bit

771
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,350
But is to.... yes, you could

772
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,110
you could land and then have a multiplier effect

773
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,550
You also had that banks come up and started to issue private bank notes

774
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,530
private bank notes

775
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,451
Effectively a liability of that bank

776
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,787
and saying it would trade

777
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,524
and the history of private bank notes is usually what

778
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:52,470
you know, good until it's really bad

779
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,760
And the history of money

780
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,620
a lot of private banks

781
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:04,500
went bust in this country around the revolutionary period again around the civil war

782
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,030
And in essence

783
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,490
that's what we have now with 1600 different cryptocurrencies

784
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,550
we have a sort of a new period of a little bit of private property currencies

785
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,220
And I only ask you to remember that as we start to look at Icos

786
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,510
initial coin offerings and so forth

787
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,500
So ledgers, the earlier question is

788
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,810
what was a Ledger? Chermo

789
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,070
You asked it can you remember what's a ledger

790
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,300
It's a way to record economic transaction

791
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,201
Yeah, principal recordings of accounts and 5000 years ago

792
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,145
you had a little reading on this

793
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:54,350
Just a medium post It wasn't meant to be a deep back economic academic paper

794
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,840
but it was to try to get

795
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,640
get the class thinking about

796
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,860
ledgers

797
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,300
This is the personal ledger of George Washington

798
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,120
our first president

799
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,935
He was 15 years old when he kept this ledger

800
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:11,220
and he apparently kept ledgers until his death

801
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,110
And let's see

802
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,190
52 years later

803
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,670
But so ledgers could be kept just to record the transactions of the day

804
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,120
He's got one up there

805
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,060
Mary Washington

806
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,050
it must have been a cousin

807
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,820
Or I can't remember if it was his mother was

808
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,320
so if they're the principal recordings of accounts and I've already sort of said this

809
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,600
they record economic activity and financial relationships

810
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,650
economic activity in a sense of transactions

811
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,430
financial relationships

812
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,390
What's the key financial relationship

813
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,420
And a ledger might record on

814
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,150
I'm sorry

815
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:54,890
Debt

816
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,890
Kelly said it, debt, and it goes back to the debate you had in the reading is money history of border

817
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,940
Did it come out of border

818
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:09,440
Did it come out of a sense of debts and credit and store of value for this purpose

819
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,910
Today, It doesn't really matter

820
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,090
It may have come from both

821
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,290
but know that it has both sides and ledgers have both sides too

822
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,573
and when we're talking about Bitcoin

823
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,120
Bitcoin, you will see is a

824
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,640
is a mechanism to store transactions

825
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,600
Some other blockchains

826
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,800
like Ethereum stores balances

827
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,280
So even in the blockchain world

828
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,921
you will see some that are balanced ledgers

829
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,780
and some which are transaction ledgers

830
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,570
not to lose you and confuse you

831
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,780
It's an important part of of what is blockchain technology

832
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,220
Some types of ledgers

833
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,440
I just mentioned one transactions versus balance

834
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,040
George Washington's ledger

835
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,630
by the way

836
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,350
I think, was a transaction ledger

837
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,350
He was just keeping, you know

838
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,940
a list of sales and movements

839
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,020
But I haven't studied President George Washington's ledger close enough

840
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,023
Does anybody know enough accounting

841
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,926
to tell me the difference between a general ledger and a subledger

842
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:14,200
or a general ledger and a supporting ledger

843
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,440
I mean, I don't want to do the whole lecture myself

844
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,170
How many of you have taken accounting

845
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,290
I taught undergraduate accounting ones

846
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,780
Sorry

847
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,490
So those of you who just put up your hand

848
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,550
who took accounting

849
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,970
did I see in the back of the room

850
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,100
Did you take accounting

851
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,120
And that's Aviva

852
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:37,940
I'm an accountant, actually

853
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
all right, all right

854
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,890
Did you pass the CPA

855
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,827
Oh we have a Certified Public Accountant who's

856
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:48,500
going to tell us the difference between a general ledger and a sub ledger

857
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,600
General Ledger is one that that records all kinds of transactions

858
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:57,700
any kind of activity that takes place to record in the general ledger and sub ledgers

859
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,760
You can call them as like a specialization

860
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,930
So let's say if there's a salary or to be paid

861
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,690
there will be a salary subledger

862
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,960
But it will also go in the general legend

863
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,490
and the other part of the transactions in the salary legend, or if there's capital

864
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,670
Or if there is some new stuff that you buy

865
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,100
So all of that goes specifically in the general legend

866
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,350
Each of them have their own specific letters

867
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,320
If you wanna say how much you spend on

868
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,280
salaries for the month and you go to your salary legacy

869
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,670
But if you wanna see over how much money you spend and how much is moved around

870
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,880
then you look at your general ledger

871
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,600
Aviva clearly said it better than I could have

872
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,890
Thank you

873
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,490
Now we know we have one CPA in the class

874
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,910
But the importance

875
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,790
it's not just a passing note

876
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,640
the importance of a general ledger and sub ledgers is there's a hierarchy as well

877
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,727
Subledgers have more detail

878
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:56,130
and maybe the net numbers kept on the general ledger

879
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,501
that is at the heart of our system of banking

880
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,971
and is at the heart of our system of financial markets

881
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:08,610
where the central bank is like a general ledger for money

882
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,350
and every commercial bank, all 9,000 of them or so in the US

883
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,760
in essence keep a sub ledger for money

884
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,923
But they do not have control of what I will call the master ledger

885
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:25,270
or general Ledger at the Federal Reserve

886
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,110
Then a third distinction about ledgers

887
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,333
A single entry a little

888
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:37,580
young, 15 year old George Washington was keeping a single entry ledger

889
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,060
just a list of things that were going on

890
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,844
And I didn't think I was going to bore the class with readings

891
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:46,350
about double entry bookkeeping because you've taken accounting

892
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,350
But does anybody want to tell me other than Aviva

893
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,620
What double entry bookkeeping

894
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,830
And she'll bail you out...

895
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,850
Double-entry bookkeeping basically means that any transaction has two places in the letter

896
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,220
One on the credit side and one on the standard side

897
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,320
because every transaction was one person lending

898
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,160
whereas the other person is getting... the thing

899
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,503
Yeah, it works for me

900
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,490
Anybody else wanted a different view

901
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:22,780
In other words,  ...asset and liability... two sites and then... to balance each other...

902
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,370
There's a balancing between assets and liabilities

903
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,824
And then the resulting bit of capitalism in it

904
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,710
Is if assets are more than liabilities

905
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,180
the rest is capitol

906
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,690
So at the heart of capitalism

907
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:36,320
in a sense

908
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,050
is double entry bookkeeping

909
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,050
And in fact

910
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,404
while it probably goes back a little over 1000 years

911
00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:47,080
when it was truly written up by the Italians in the 13 hundreds

912
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,170
it start started to help

913
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,220
You are come out of the dark ages

914
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,590
I mean, the commercial renaissance of the middle ages

915
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,300
Some would say was in part not entirely

916
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,780
but in part, on the backs of double entry bookkeeping

917
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,190
So ledgers matter is my point

918
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,580
They're not going to be the heart and soul of this class

919
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,330
But Bitcoin

920
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,480
which is a transaction ledger

921
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,280
Ethereum

922
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,890
which is a balance ledger

923
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,770
our financial system

924
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,970
which is all set up on ledgers

925
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,770
is a relevant sort of subtext

926
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,680
You don't have to be afraid of it just as you don't have to be afraid of

927
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,920
of hashing power that we'll be talking about on Thursday and cryptography

928
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,670
But you'd have to have some you know

929
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,840
sort of basic sense of where's

930
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,421
where's Bitcoin fitted in terms of ledgers

931
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:37,660
does anybody, I didn't fill this slide in

932
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,010
You'll find out it's blank

933
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:42,310
Does anybody want to tell me what some characteristics of a good ledger

934
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,550
Because again

935
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,850
as you start to think about your blockchain projects later in the semester

936
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,003
it's like what makes a good ledger that I don't have any answers here

937
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:55,000
The bitcoin were immutable

938
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,645
So you want it to be immutable, maybe

939
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,030
Thalita, can you do me a favor and keep these

940
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,100
We'll put them on the slides, when we put

941
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,542
we'll keep the classes list and we'll put them in the slides, immutable

942
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:06,193
I like that

943
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:09,090
that anybody else want to grab something

944
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,180
which is a good ledger

945
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:11,550
Time stamped

946
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,380
What is that?

947
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,600
Time stamped

948
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,740
All right So that

949
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,720
you know when you made your entry

950
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,160
Kelly

951
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,870
Ownership -- Ownership

952
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,960
What do you mean by ownership

953
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,780
Essentially the receiver and the person giving

954
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,670
So essentially

955
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,170
who's taking what he's giving

956
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,250
So it was a transaction

957
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,690
the two counterparties to the transaction

958
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,540
right

959
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,290
And if it's a balance than who owns the balance

960
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,410
I was just adding a little bit to

961
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,620
Let's see if we have a new name or face back here on the

962
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,980
on the back table

963
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,660
I haven't chatted with you yet

964
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,820
What is that

965
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,260
Ross -- Ross

966
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:48,670
Thank you

967
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:48,940
Ross

968
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,590
Good to meet you

969
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,990
Pleasure to meet you, as well. Accuracy

970
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,000
Accuracy

971
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,310
So Ross says accuracy

972
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,500
And could we take one or two more

973
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,540
Just a description of the transaction

974
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,500
So Andrew says a description of the transaction

975
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,410
And last, Mr... -- Comprehensive

976
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,140
What's that? Comprehensive

977
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,352
So all good attributes of a characteristics

978
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:15,122
somebody's burning desire that we missed one or two?

979
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:17,520
Jihei? All right

980
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,240
I just was curious on consistency maybe

981
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,440
but I don't know if that's...

982
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,340
Well, I think that's inside of immutability

983
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,470
that in essence

984
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,120
that it's valid that you can't

985
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,940
you can't change it

986
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,760
You can't counterfeit it and the like

987
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,410
And what you'll find is the characteristics of a good ledger

988
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,210
is also in some part similar to the characters of good money

989
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,320
They're not identical

990
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,317
but they overlap a lot

991
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:44,620
payment systems

992
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,540
I'm just going to say one line about it

993
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,490
It's a method basically

994
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,750
to amend and record changes in a ledger for money

995
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,990
I know it's not what you usually think about a payment system

996
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,165
but if you go into Starbucks

997
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,434
and buy a cup of coffee

998
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,360
and use your cell phone

999
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,670
aren't you really just amending a set of ledgers

1000
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,340
Starbucks is

1001
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,780
ledger goes up

1002
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,410
And yep

1003
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,890
your ledger goes down

1004
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,250
Well

1005
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,260
your monetary ledger goes up

1006
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,250
Your utility

1007
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,770
your fulfillment from that latte might go up

1008
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,320
I'm talking about the financial ledger

1009
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,510
So I just wanted to ground when we talk about payment systems to think about

1010
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,030
it's really just a way to amend

1011
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,060
Usually two parties ledgers

1012
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,130
one going up

1013
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,438
one going down

1014
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,240
Now in an earlier time

1015
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,376
it was handing somebody a bit of gold

1016
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:44,690
or a bit of silver

1017
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,840
and it was not recorded on central ledgers

1018
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,560
But we already live in an age of electronics

1019
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,340
So this is really what a payment system largely is

1020
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,370
It's not entirely

1021
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,430
There's still some other ways to do finance

1022
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,980
So what were some early forms of payment systems that did just that

1023
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,550
That moved and changed ledgers

1024
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,590
They're called negotiable orders

1025
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,241
I would dare say that most of you probably have not

1026
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:17,511
used negotiable orders of withdrawal that much

1027
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,610
in the last week or the last month

1028
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:25,450
Is anybody here written a personal check in the last week

1029
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,690
But in an earlier era

1030
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,492
it would have been the whole class

1031
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,520
anybody in the class

1032
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
not even have a checkbook

1033
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,800
Three quarters of the class

1034
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,520
Larry how's that make you feel -- Getting old

1035
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,836
But a checkbook is, in essence

1036
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:50,740
with a... what do you put on a check?

1037
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,295
What's... These are... this is all about Bitcoin now

1038
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:55,349
I'm not doing this just as a

1039
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,319
walk down memory lane for Larry and myself

1040
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:03,103
What's the... what are the important pieces of a negotiable order

1041
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:04,300
Withdrawal or check

1042
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,360
Put your signature on it

1043
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,300
So there's a signature

1044
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,470
What else is there

1045
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,060
I want to get to people I haven't talked to, in the back

1046
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,060
I can't remember your name

1047
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,930
Me? I'm Dana

1048
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:19,010
You put who you're paying to, how much, and what it's for

1049
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,890
All right

1050
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,890
so there is a bunch

1051
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,150
So a signature

1052
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,310
a payee

1053
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,850
how much and what it was for

1054
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,320
what else

1055
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,590
There is an account number and routing numbers

1056
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,050
Account numbers and routing numbers

1057
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,023
So think about account numbers and routing numbers is to

1058
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:40,520
just say, in essence

1059
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,510
what ledger is this coming from

1060
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,060
And the payee is the ledger

1061
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,750
It's to whom it's going

1062
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,820
And I'm sorry, Dan?

1063
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,150
Also a date -- And a date

1064
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,720
So there's a time stamp

1065
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,290
a signature

1066
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,060
a payee

1067
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,115
the payor in the form of the account number

1068
00:50:01,115 --> 00:50:02,480
and an amount

1069
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,340
Those five are really critical

1070
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,390
and you'll find them are going to be right in the middle of all this Bitcoin

1071
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,910
And then the reason why you're

1072
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,250
you know

1073
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,190
some other information

1074
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,862
I'm sorry, was there something else

1075
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:18,080
Kyle -- Kyle -- I just have a question

1076
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,200
Would you consider something like PayPal

1077
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,620
or Venmo like a negotiable order?

1078
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,880
They may be

1079
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,490
They may be new forms

1080
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,680
They're certainly parts of the payment system

1081
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,290
Why they might not be negotiable orders or withdrawal

1082
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:38,752
They might not be a direct authorization for a bank

1083
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:41,790
with one ledger to move money to another ledger

1084
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:46,680
They might be moving it on their own ledger, that's a...

1085
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,250
but you're asking the right question

1086
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,130
So some early money that we already talked about

1087
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:52,930
that was Ledger

1088
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,520
Were the tally sticks in England and the Yap stone

1089
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,570
These were ledger types and forms of money

1090
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,330
and was kind of interesting

1091
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:04,700
So ledgers didn't just come with electricity and computers

1092
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,750
So now let's get back to fiat currency

1093
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,580
The heart of a earlier question

1094
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,170
And we already talked about it

1095
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,920
So let's see how the professor did

1096
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,391
Cause you already said some of the things that you said

1097
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:21,858
were fiat currency. One social and economic consensus

1098
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:27,220
I don't... I'm in this school that it's just part of the history

1099
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,105
It's not that different than everything that came

1100
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:35,576
even though it built on that promissory note from China 700 years ago

1101
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:37,000
in the private bank notes

1102
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,400
it got in the goldsmiths in the 17 hundreds

1103
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,485
But ultimately governments took control

1104
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:47,300
That represents central bank liabilities

1105
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,160
And that's important

1106
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,740
It's a liability of a central bank

1107
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,020
It's not an asset

1108
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,930
It's their liability side

1109
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,660
But it's also

1110
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:58,220
guess what

1111
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,990
There's a second form of money

1112
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,810
And that's when you make a

1113
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,260
you have a deposit in a bank

1114
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,450
That's a liability of a commercial bank

1115
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,680
Central bank is the top gold standard of sense using the word gold

1116
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,450
But it's the top ledger

1117
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,720
Commercial banks are like subledgers in a sense

1118
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:19,960
Please, Alan?

1119
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,750
Sure. I'm not an economist or anything

1120
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,524
but what does it mean to be

1121
00:52:23,524 --> 00:52:26,790
for a coin or a note to be a liability of the central bank?

1122
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,240
What does that actually mean?

1123
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,480
So before I answer

1124
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,520
does anybody want to try to answer what it is?

1125
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,337
Eric?

1126
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:44,077
Liability is basically an obligation, to, in this case, pay someone an amount

1127
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,880
So because it's a social consensus

1128
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,940
it's a very good question that Alan asked is

1129
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,087
what does it mean to be a liability of a central bank

1130
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,680
when it's just the currency in our pocket

1131
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,180
This Federal Reserve note

1132
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,240
this says Federal Reserve note on it

1133
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:03,770
And

1134
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,420
Right

1135
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,130
We can pass it around

1136
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,990
I'm not afraid it's only a dollar

1137
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,340
but, you know, right

1138
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,310
You want me to pass around 20s and then I want them back

1139
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,050
But it says better reserve note, right?

1140
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,270
So it's a liability of the commercial bank

1141
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,160
in a earlier day

1142
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,060
it was said you could exchange it for gold or silver

1143
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,550
Right, so that's what I don't understand...

1144
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:36,260
But by the 1930s for retail deposits in the middle of the depression

1145
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,080
President Roosevelt said, no more

1146
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,810
You can not

1147
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,950
You could not redeem gold and silver

1148
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:45,138
And then President Nixon in the 1970 said in the official sector

1149
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,980
that he was going off of the... until that point in time

1150
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,770
other governments could redeem in gold

1151
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,790
But when paper money started

1152
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,320
it was not backed by gold

1153
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,580
We had a period of the gold standard we were on and off of it

1154
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,940
We fell off of it after World War... during World War I

1155
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,120
We went back on it

1156
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:09,196
It would be a false narrative to say that we were on

1157
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:12,140
the gold standard for our first 140 years

1158
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,280
I just wanted to clear that up

1159
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,350
I mean, we sort of went on the gold standard

1160
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,310
We went off

1161
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,560
we went back on and so forth

1162
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,560
But it is a liability on the books and records

1163
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,760
So as a matter of accounting and double entry bookkeeping

1164
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,000
I will show you in a minute

1165
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,800
The balance sheet of the Federal Reserve

1166
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,530
And I'll come back to this question

1167
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,220
Is that all right

1168
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,360
Can you clarify what is the bank liable for?

1169
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,524
So before, it gave me a dollar

1170
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,127
and I could go to the dollar and get back to the gold, right?

1171
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,494
Right

1172
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:42,220
Now, what is it liable for now

1173
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,740
It is, in essence, a social

1174
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,690
It's the first point

1175
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,420
the... I'm going to separate it

1176
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,480
The central bank is liable that they will move on its ledgers

1177
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,220
If you want to move that to somewhere else

1178
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,740
So you could take that physical $1 in and say

1179
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,949
I want to deposit this in a bank

1180
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:06,130
and they have to record it on the ledger of that bank

1181
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,240
That is what they're... that is

1182
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,670
And the US government

1183
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,193
which is technically separate from the central bank

1184
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:16,350
or the UK government or the Chinese government

1185
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,300
They are all technically separate from their banks

1186
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,510
People's Bank of China or the Bank of England

1187
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,490
Their governments are saying they will accept it for payments against taxes

1188
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,170
So there's a so... set of social constructs

1189
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,490
It relies on a...

1190
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,620
I'm going to just go through this to answer your question

1191
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,700
It relies on a system of ledgers

1192
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,189
and it's an integration of those ledgers between the

1193
00:55:42,189 --> 00:55:44,291
banking system and the commercial banks

1194
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,800
In the US we have about 9000 commercial banks

1195
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,810
And what the Federal Reserve is saying

1196
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,070
But it's true about the People's Bank of China

1197
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,330
It's true about the European Central Bank

1198
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,260
Each of these central banks are basically saying

1199
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,880
if you bring your paper money in

1200
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,513
we will record it on the ledger of a commercial bank

1201
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:11,160
and you can pay your taxes to our sister over here called the government

1202
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,060
That's... I'm sorry to let you down

1203
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,750
It's not more than that

1204
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,380
Sorry, Alan

1205
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,640
I have a potential answer

1206
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,830
I might be totally wrong

1207
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:20,120
Please, go

1208
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,032
I think it's a legal and sustainable way to conduct a Ponzi scheme

1209
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:31,240
With, yeah, with a proper Ponzi scheme

1210
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,158
where the value will increase by 1% to 3%

1211
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:38,420
If you.. if a central bank reaches the goal of inflation

1212
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,910
Right, any other points of view in that

1213
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,030
I saw

1214
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,500
I saw

1215
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,480
I don't

1216
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:43,900
I don't

1217
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,800
I don't know your name

1218
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:45,040
Oh

1219
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:45,250
no

1220
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,710
you don't want to say anything

1221
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:46,930
No

1222
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,520
all right

1223
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,406
I think it will go back to point one, right

1224
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:55,154
So it's a construct that someone would give you something

1225
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:57,236
So your dollar where the central bank

1226
00:56:57,236 --> 00:57:00,534
the central bank owes you that dollars worth of whatever you desire

1227
00:57:00,534 --> 00:57:03,203
and someone will happily take that dollar

1228
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:05,981
from the central bank and give you the goods that you want

1229
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,064
So it's a roundabout way of...

1230
00:57:08,064 --> 00:57:11,645
it's a way of transacting something

1231
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:14,000
whetever the dollar has...

1232
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,149
It's also central bank liability

1233
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:18,985
Because like whenever the government has sovereign debt

1234
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:20,140
it can just issue new notes

1235
00:57:20,765 --> 00:57:22,189
It's liable

1236
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:25,325
So that's why it's a liability because you can only issue notes

1237
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,220
against a certain amount of reserves that you...

1238
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,500
So that's why it...

1239
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,097
That's why you repudiate as a liability

1240
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,370
because you can't just issue new notes whenever you need them

1241
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,780
You can't just make new money out of thin air

1242
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,360
So you're liable for every new note

1243
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,575
I'm gonna take one more comment on this

1244
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:43,300
and then give a couple more things, here

1245
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,820
The currency is actually a small part of the

1246
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,080
the total reserves

1247
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,600
the federal reserve system

1248
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,630
I think maybe the bank reserves

1249
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,455
or maybe a more applicable application

1250
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,020
because the bank can actually require the Fed to print money by making more loans

1251
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:05,020
So in that way, is that mechanism to ensure that liability

1252
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,550
So I'm very pleased with this discussion

1253
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:12,040
Even Alan's contributions about the schemes

1254
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,490
This is the debate

1255
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,910
If Jay Powell were here

1256
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,760
how many of you know who Jay Powell is

1257
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,430
Who is Jay Powell

1258
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,620
It's a lab  -- Jay powell

1259
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,750
No, who's Jay powell

1260
00:58:26,953 --> 00:58:27,580
Head of the...

1261
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:28,630
Head of the Federal Reserve

1262
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,240
Thank you, sorry

1263
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,870
But if Jay Powell were here

1264
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,540
he'd have a laugh along with what Alan just said

1265
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,835
But, he would say, also

1266
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:46,800
the liability is a social liability as well

1267
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,174
that a central banker

1268
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:51,378
to their core beliefs of what they are trying to do

1269
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:56,983
is ensure for the stability of this social thing we call money

1270
00:58:56,983 --> 00:59:01,690
and to make sure that it doesn't get debased and it has some value

1271
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,200
And so it's accepted for taxes

1272
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,660
We talked about notes and coins are legal tender for all debts

1273
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,770
Public and private

1274
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:16,320
I walk into a Starbucks and I say I'd like a cup of coffee

1275
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:21,308
Here's my $5 or whatever it costs these days

1276
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:25,060
does the person behind the counter have to brew the coffee

1277
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,480
Is just a yes or no?

1278
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,380
Can I see?

1279
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,480
Who wants to go for it?

1280
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,720
There's a no from Christopher

1281
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,540
What, Chris? Alright

1282
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,850
there's a no from Chris, who agrees with Chris

1283
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:40,520
Okay

1284
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,000
they brew the cup of coffee

1285
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,640
I go to the other side of the counter

1286
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,090
The coffee sitting there, now

1287
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,570
Do they have to accept my $5 at that point

1288
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,490
Yes

1289
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,800
before they brew the coffee

1290
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,580
nobody has to take dollars

1291
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,480
But once a debt is established

1292
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,360
they produced the good

1293
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,660
They provided the service

1294
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,050
They have to take it

1295
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,760
Just a small little thing

1296
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,400
That's what legal tender is

1297
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,658
So there's many establishments around the globe

1298
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:14,730
that are basically now putting little signs out

1299
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,060
We don't take Swedish corona

1300
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,140
We don't take this

1301
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,410
We don't take that

1302
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:21,770
In paper form

1303
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,261
they'll still take it electronically

1304
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:25,096
And there's sort of

1305
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:28,770
there's a new little bit of definition thing going on about legal tender

1306
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,390
There's also some unique tax treatments

1307
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:34,100
but I'm not going to go through the currency

1308
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,730
So central banking and money

1309
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:36,990
We talked about a little bit

1310
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,670
This is a kind of chart that I borrowed from

1311
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,330
from a... somebody else's paper

1312
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,750
But the central banks at the top is at the center

1313
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,950
And if Alice and Bob and we'll be talking about Alice and Bob in Bitcoin time

1314
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,030
so you can pull this chart down later

1315
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,760
I want to transact

1316
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,610
And they're at the same commercial bank, bank number one

1317
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,580
then commercial bank number one has to change their ledgers

1318
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,900
moving money from Alice to Bob

1319
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:05,420
In essence

1320
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,170
if you're both two people at Bank of America

1321
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,070
you can move the your balance at Bank of America

1322
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,810
But if you're a bank of America going over to Citicorp

1323
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,900
then something has to go between two ledgers

1324
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,720
Bank of America's Ledger and City Corpse Ledger

1325
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:30,403
And the only way to transact between 2 bank's ledgers

1326
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:33,440
is some balancing act has to happen

1327
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,550
at the top ledger called the central bank

1328
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,090
And later

1329
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:40,540
when we talk about payment systems

1330
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,280
I'm going to use this slide again later in the semester

1331
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,600
That's why I'm not going to spend as much time now on it

1332
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,800
We're going to talk about ledgers

1333
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,800
And when you move money between 2 banks

1334
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,126
it's all within one closed system

1335
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:58,480
that countries or that they society's central banking system

1336
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:03,570
But then it gets really a little bit more iffy and woolly

1337
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,310
when you are moving from one currency to another currency

1338
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,330
Because how do you make two closed ledger systems operable?

1339
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,270
Not for today

1340
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:20,353
but we'll go through that later when we do payment systems and the like

1341
01:02:20,353 --> 01:02:22,840
The central bank

1342
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:23,950
The US central bank

1343
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,610
This was the only good slide I could find

1344
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:27,280
which was about a year old

1345
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:30,950
Its liabilities and assets are about 4 and 1/4 trillion dollars

1346
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:36,340
$4.3 trillion. $1.7 trillion of that is in currency

1347
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,370
Do I get my $1 back

1348
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,200
By the way I mean

1349
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,020
my liability

1350
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,740
Yeah

1351
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:48,010
So $1.7 trillion of those greenbacks are in circulation

1352
01:02:49,215 --> 01:02:50,530
And remarkably

1353
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,580
even though half of you probably don't use cash that much

1354
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,890
you don't even have checking accounts

1355
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,226
The amount of cash in circulation is growing faster

1356
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:03,210
than the economy in most developed nations

1357
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,299
Why do you think that is?

1358
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,702
Probably one word

1359
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,590
The amount of 2008 crisis...

1360
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,810
Oh that's more than one word

1361
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,677
Drugs

1362
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:18,311
Trust

1363
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:19,750
Oh trust

1364
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,380
I thought you said drugs

1365
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,910
Trust

1366
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,650
Well it does have to do a trust

1367
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,370
but it also has to do with drugs

1368
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:33,510
Paper currency is a wonderful method of of money laundering

1369
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,720
drug running and a store of value

1370
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,131
So there's certain segments of our economy

1371
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:40,033
and segments of the worldwide economy

1372
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:42,760
that does not want to be in the electronic banking system

1373
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,020
I'm going to slip through these quickly

1374
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,470
but there's another piece that we need for this whole class

1375
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:54,330
and for the semester is credit and credit intermediation

1376
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,000
But just a little thing

1377
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,890
Credit cards started only 60 or 70 years ago

1378
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:03,240
But they go back to a book a little over 100 years ago

1379
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:08,290
The word credit cards used 18 times in this book where

1380
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:12,340
a science fiction writer in 1887 said

1381
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,690
what would the world be like in the year 2000

1382
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,610
And it was the first we used the word credit card

1383
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,920
and he said they would

1384
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,900
society would have a form of money

1385
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,570
And you could have credit against it

1386
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,640
And it's a fascinating thing that somebody could be that visionary

1387
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,680
But there were merchant cards starting

1388
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,110
So maybe he wasn't so visionary

1389
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,020
Oil companies in the 1920s

1390
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,340
charge cards were starting

1391
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,730
but they were single merchant cards

1392
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,095
You could have credit from that merchant

1393
01:04:43,062 --> 01:04:46,680
In 1946 in a bank in Brooklyn

1394
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,070
a guy named Biggins, started with that

1395
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,830
That was the first real charge it

1396
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:57,270
You could charge things in a few dozen places in Brooklyn

1397
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,070
literally

1398
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,682
And then all of a sudden it took off

1399
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:05,230
Diners Club started in the early 1950s

1400
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,590
They found that they could get a bunch of restaurants to say

1401
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,490
wouldn't you want to extend credit

1402
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:14,100
And we'll back at American Express in the mid 1950s

1403
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,460
And then finally in the mid 1960s

1404
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,432
Bank America, which is that time was a California bank

1405
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:26,680
figured out they would create a co-operative with a bunch of other US banks to extend credit

1406
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:30,280
And the credit boom took off

1407
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,350
And what was interesting

1408
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:35,160
the laws to regulate all this didn't come until the 1970s

1409
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,490
at least in the US

1410
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,510
the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all the other laws

1411
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,610
There's three big ones in the 1970s

1412
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:46,010
So those who... I go to conferences sometime to talk about Bitcoin regulation

1413
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,910
and they say, well, why can't the government solve this now

1414
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:56,140
I sort of remind them that it took 15 to 20 years from the introduction of credit cards

1415
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,370
kind of in the early to mid 1950s

1416
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,900
And the real takeoff in the 1960s

1417
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:04,250
It was 1974 1977

1418
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,650
The three big credit laws

1419
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,049
So if you're going to be an entrepreneur in Bitcoin

1420
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,318
know that it could be 15 years

1421
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,222
until there's some crypto loss in the future

1422
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,740
that was the processing machine from the 1950s

1423
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,210
I know I made it too small

1424
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,070
Sorry

1425
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,810
Visa made it better

1426
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:27,310
And then of course

1427
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,160
that's what we all see today

1428
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,860
how your cards get processed

1429
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,480
So the role of money we've talked about

1430
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,610
So I'm going to skip over that

1431
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:39,440
But now the characteristics of money

1432
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:43,660
what makes a good money, we talked about some of this earlier

1433
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:44,610
it's durable

1434
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,640
meaning that, that salt cube wasn't the greatest because of a lot of rain came

1435
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,580
That would be kind of wash away

1436
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,210
Gold and silver metals are durable

1437
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,350
They are portable

1438
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,530
The heavier it is

1439
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,770
the less portable it is

1440
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:01,634
And that's why gold was a better money than silver

1441
01:07:01,634 --> 01:07:02,630
you could move it

1442
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,600
And better than copper bronze

1443
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,430
It was divisible, easily

1444
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,290
You could slice things up

1445
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,840
uniform and fungible

1446
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,940
And anyone who is down the rabbit hole on this stuff

1447
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,980
If you really want to learn about money

1448
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:21,930
read about Crawford versus Royal Bank in 1749

1449
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:32,070
There was a gentleman at the early part of paper money that mailed two £20 notes

1450
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,690
And he wrote his name on them

1451
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,536
They got lost in the mail

1452
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:39,972
and he took the banks to court

1453
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,230
to say those were mine when they were found

1454
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,460
And there was no law in Scotland or in England at the time as to what to do about it

1455
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:52,070
But if you lose or somebody stole a piece of art

1456
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,420
you get it back

1457
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:58,490
And the law was settled in 1749 that you actually don't get your money back

1458
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,780
Does anybody want to guess as to why the courts

1459
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,164
It was a matter of first interpretation

1460
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,065
the courts had no

1461
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:11,030
they had no jurisprudence on this before 1749

1462
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,638
Why did the courts decide

1463
01:08:12,638 --> 01:08:16,790
that a piece of art was different than currency

1464
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,560
And it goes to the fundamental of what money is, fiat money is

1465
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,947
Anybody want to take a guess as to why the courts

1466
01:08:24,947 --> 01:08:26,533
They could've gone the other way

1467
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:29,530
How could you tell if someone really owned money?

1468
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,960
He signed it

1469
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:33,120
It was actually... the facts were clear

1470
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,760
It was the currency he signed

1471
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,590
I'm just helping you out so that... that's a good point

1472
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:40,860
But he signed it

1473
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,990
It can't be used as a medium of exchange if you

1474
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:47,740
if it doesn't belong to the person...

1475
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,950
In essence, if you were to go back and read

1476
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,910
there is some history on this, and read the court cases

1477
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,020
This was the point

1478
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,860
The court basically said we have to make this a medium of exchange

1479
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,890
This is a greater social good

1480
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,340
It has to be fungible

1481
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,530
And the Royal Bank of Scotland was

1482
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,500
of course

1483
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,770
the kind of

1484
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,530
you know

1485
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,710
closer to the courts than this gentleman

1486
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,830
Crawford

1487
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:15,530
but the banks were also saying that we can't keep track of this

1488
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,020
So it was a mixture of the two

1489
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,950
but it made it fungible

1490
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,270
Eric

1491
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,930
Was it those specific notes that he had signed?

1492
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,570
Yeah

1493
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,460
and in 1749

1494
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,960
they all had serial numbers and they were signed in a way that not today

1495
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,310
of course

1496
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,730
they're acceptable

1497
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,080
And they're stable

1498
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,370
And we're going to talk a lot about the last point

1499
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,650
They're stable because they're hard to mine

1500
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,794
And Bitcoin has that embedded in it as well

1501
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,220
the design of money is really important as well

1502
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:46,710
You can make it a token

1503
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,168
A token is like something physical

1504
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,370
or a count based

1505
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,320
We are, of course

1506
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,707
now living in a world of account based money

1507
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:57,270
and its digital not physical

1508
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,549
It can be issued by the private sector just like bank notes in the 18th century

1509
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:07,210
or private sector like Bitcoin or it can be central

1510
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,850
It can be widely acceptable or just wholesale

1511
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,770
There are forms of wholesale money

1512
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,130
One of the biggest forms of wholesale money is the central banks'

1513
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,450
Reserves are only available to the commercial banking system

1514
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:23,040
We're going to study this money flower later

1515
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,480
but I put it in the slides because, this

1516
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,340
I didn't create this flower

1517
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,612
You have a reading later in the semester from the Bank of International Settlement

1518
01:10:32,612 --> 01:10:34,390
that has this money flower in it

1519
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,683
But it's basically across these four things

1520
01:10:37,683 --> 01:10:42,924
is a token or account based physical or digital private or central or widely accessible

1521
01:10:42,924 --> 01:10:46,298
And then all monies fall into one piece of this money flower

1522
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:49,462
There's a Professor Garrett that came up with this flower

1523
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:53,680
And there is an optional reading later in the semester from him

1524
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,770
You had a reading from Clark

1525
01:10:58,770 --> 01:10:59,990
There's not enough time

1526
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,460
but all this stuff failed

1527
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,511
Does anybody want to give me a flavor for one or two reasons

1528
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,260
why a bunch of digital cash failed

1529
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,100
Did anybody read the clerk reading the history of some DigiCash

1530
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,820
Oh, Alan read it

1531
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,880
Anybody else read it

1532
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,360
Over here

1533
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,300
I can't... --Zhan

1534
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,005
Don. So what did you

1535
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:18,192
Zhan -- What?

1536
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:19,525
zhan -- zhan, zhan

1537
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,660
what did you take from the reading?

1538
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,860
Why did these all fail?

1539
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,730
What's like the one or two biggest reasons they failed

1540
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:28,088
Most of them still relied on kind of some form of a central authority

1541
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:30,202
All right, they relied on central...

1542
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:33,906
DigiCash certainly did it, David Chaum's case, and some of the others

1543
01:11:33,906 --> 01:11:36,230
Any other big reason? Alan, did you have--

1544
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,680
There wasn't enough adoption by merchants, I recall

1545
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,480
Definitely not adoption by merchants

1546
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:41,880
Very good

1547
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,040
Third reason why they failed one

1548
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,340
That's at the core of what Bitcoin solved

1549
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,640
Incentivizing like a decentralized network to keep that ledger, maintain the ledger

1550
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,400
Alright, and standardizing the ledger, behind her

1551
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,398
They couldn't solve the double spend Problem

1552
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,040
That's it, couldn't spend the double spend problem

1553
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,790
Could a currency be spent not just once, but twice

1554
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,630
So there's 4 things that were raised

1555
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,130
Four things that about centralization

1556
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,670
The double spend

1557
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,920
They couldn't get merchants to adopt it

1558
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,500
And there was a couldn't

1559
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,470
Some form of consensus as to what the ledger was

1560
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,190
I'm going to flip through these quickly

1561
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:21,100
but digital and mobile money did happen

1562
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,640
We were asked about PayPal earlier

1563
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,810
It was 1998 in Norway

1564
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:30,629
Eriksen and Telenor had the first mobile app

1565
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:33,680
and it was to get movies on your mobile phone

1566
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,270
1999, Alipay comes along that

1567
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,800
We'll talk a lot about when we do payments later

1568
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:41,970
And of course

1569
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,644
M-pesa so that we talked about a little last week in Kenya

1570
01:12:45,644 --> 01:12:51,350
where Safaricom noticed that a bunch of money... near money

1571
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,190
It was mobile minutes that was being used as money in Kenya

1572
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:58,040
And now there's 20 million users of that

1573
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:58,620
And of course

1574
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,030
there's a bunch of regulations now and so forth

1575
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,370
Starbucks started in 2011

1576
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,210
And then, of course

1577
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,420
it's now off to the races in mobile money

1578
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,120
One of the key things about mobile money

1579
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,500
we will discuss and learn together is the question

1580
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:20,290
Each one of these is where is the stored value

1581
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,380
And I have to tell you

1582
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,570
sometimes I get quite confused when I research a new app

1583
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:28,053
Are they storing the value

1584
01:13:28,053 --> 01:13:33,030
or are they just a processing provider to move...

1585
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,990
As we said earlier

1586
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:38,798
payment systems move and change and amend other ledgers

1587
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:42,020
in a number of these like M-Pesa

1588
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:44,403
Initially they were storing the value

1589
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:47,150
and mobile app Starbucks stores the value

1590
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,200
but many of them are just applications

1591
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,040
computer code to move the ledger somewhere else

1592
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,720
But the riddle remained

1593
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,840
You remember that riddle

1594
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,760
How to move money

1595
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,840
Peer to peer without a central authority

1596
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:09,630
And that's what I'm asking for next class, Thursday, to actually read

1597
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,250
I wouldn't win it, and I wouldn't be afraid of it

1598
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:19,690
Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper that everybody in this class

1599
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:22,430
If you were at MIT and a fewer viewer at Harvard

1600
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,060
I'm telling you can read it

1601
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,140
You'll understand maybe a half to two-thirds of it

1602
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,990
It's not deeply technical

1603
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:34,560
It's, and it's only 8 or 9 pages

1604
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,050
I've also assigned National Institute of Science Technology

1605
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,570
about 20 pages of reading from Nest

1606
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,920
The question is whether that's Bitcoin

1607
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,780
I'm going to skip through the study questions

1608
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,735
but the study questions are really about cryptography

1609
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,730
and how append only time stamping

1610
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,410
We are going to get into the nitty gritty over three lectures

1611
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,740
I couldn't commit the whole play, the course the whole semester

1612
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:02,800
And but I think three lectures, Thursday and the two next week

1613
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:04,690
anytime you want to come to see me

1614
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,960
Sabrina is somewhere here, on the floor

1615
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,655
Who's one of our Tas

1616
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:14,026
is a computer science master student and knows more

1617
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:17,220
about all of this. Madores, who was here last week

1618
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,860
I don't know if Madores is here

1619
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:21,020
He was part of the digital currency initiative

1620
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,860
Over three lectures

1621
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,970
We're going to try to work through

1622
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:28,040
what's the cryptography and why is that matter

1623
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,060
How does the time stamping happen

1624
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,000
How does this look like money

1625
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,380
And how do the transactions kept

1626
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,830
Yes

1627
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,740
You get to close it out, almost

1628
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,170
Can you just answer the question posed about the longest running blockchain?

1629
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,660
I can answer that

1630
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,350
but the assignment was to answer it by Thursday, right?

1631
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,180
So by Thursday

1632
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,540
what's your first name?

1633
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,820
Caroline

1634
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,570
Did I say I was going to answer it today...

1635
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,160
Oh did I say today？

1636
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,080
No, is there a mutable record of what I said?

1637
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:00,290
I'll answer it now if you want

1638
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,490
But who... does anyone have the answer in the whole class?

1639
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:11,379
Yeah. It's a service called Surety that Gillespie begun

1640
01:16:11,379 --> 01:16:16,040
begun working in 1995, was a time stamp

1641
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,160
service for digital documents

1642
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:25,190
And the way they did was use a hash function to create a seal

1643
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,167
with a timestamp of the document

1644
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,750
and then process the weekly batch of seals

1645
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:36,900
And they actually published it in the New York Times in its homes

1646
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,300
So Carolyn, is good to raise the question

1647
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,490
I thought it was for Thursday

1648
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:42,490
But thank you

1649
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:46,685
Stewart Haber, a cryptographer

1650
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:51,300
and a colleague at Bell Labs in the early 90s, said

1651
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,240
how do we notarize information digitally notarize

1652
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,390
And we're going to be talking about this Thursday a lot

1653
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,150
They used a cryptographic method called hash functions

1654
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,390
And they were just trying to notarize information

1655
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,470
And by 1995, they took

1656
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,680
they were entrepreneurs

1657
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,670
They created a company called Surety

1658
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:15,540
And once a week they publish in the New York Times

1659
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,800
and they still do it

1660
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,660
You can get a New York Times

1661
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,700
I believe it's on Saturday or Sunday

1662
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:21,720
and they take

1663
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:26,140
it's in the classified section and they have the hash function

1664
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:28,500
which you'll read about between now and Thursday

1665
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:33,000
They have the hash of all the preexisting information

1666
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,450
And so they time stamp it by using the New York Times

1667
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,330
And they use cryptography

1668
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,990
And it's currently 23 years and running

1669
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:43,409
So that's the longest in terms of time

1670
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,470
not the longest with how many ledgers, or how many...

1671
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,060
Correct, because

1672
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:51,450
Bitcoin is about 550000 blocks

1673
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:52,630
And this would be whatever

1674
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:57,350
23 years times 52 is,  longest in time

1675
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,000
Thank you

1676
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,430
I look forward to seeing you
