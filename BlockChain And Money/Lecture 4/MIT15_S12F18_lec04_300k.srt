Hello

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,710
 everybody 

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,260
Good weekend

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,260
 everybody 

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,470
Staying dry

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,230
 I hope

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,910
 Sort of a dive back into blockchain money 

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,360
And we didn't

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,890
 we didn't lose too many people when we did cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures last week 

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,010
So I thank you for all being back 

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,360
So what we're today's study questions again 

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,160
What's the Byzantine general's problem 

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,430
Anybody want to tell me what the Byzantine general problem is

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:03,920
 Ben 

18
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,160
So this is the general problem is

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,228
 was a sort of general method puzzle 

20
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,690
And basically what it is is how you coordinate 

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,100
And they might be 

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,780
So he's not acting in the best interest of the 

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,150
I hadn't thought of that 

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,530
Yeah

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:26,590
 get it 

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,836
So there

27
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:29,307
 there

28
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:36,400
 there might be how to coordinate when somebody's not acting in good faith is a malicious actor 

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,750
But it also might be just somebody that doesn't get the communication

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,980
 somebody that is

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,230
 there's a fault whether it's malicious or not 

32
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,490
How are we doing

33
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,070
 Eileen 

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,090
 how does proof of work and mining in Bitcoin address it 

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,740
We're going to walk through this 

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm going to give you my sense of it 

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,330
But does anybody want to give a short short version of prepared for

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,110
 oh

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,750
 brotish 

41
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,191
The proposal book is essentially a solid stick 

42
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,208
If you have a problem

43
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:15,716
 stick with

44
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,411
 or then I determine to speak with

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,080
 by using

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,924
 I want the CPU power to solve a problem

47
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:29,864
 a certain complexity to prove that one consensus has been reached by a majority of the part of the business 

48
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:30,312
Alright

49
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,222
 so what brothers said is it's probabilistic 

50
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:37,560
Instead of deterministic that you use CPU power

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,610
 to form some consensus 

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,590
I think that's what you said 

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm going to walk through this in more detail 

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,660
But does anybody want to give a

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,160
 another shot at it 

56
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,680
I could say 

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,700
One of is posted and my nurse

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,840
 as I described to solving

59
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,470
 I'm more forgetful

60
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,440
 oh 

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,210
I would also say it requires a lot of work 

62
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,190
Suck me kind of pulling me cup 

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,820
Okay

64
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,370
 so easy 

65
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,430
Take computers 

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,310
So there is a fucking round 

67
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,470
So

68
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,510
 remind me your first name rehab 

69
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,282
Rehab says it's about

70
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:43,874
 people called miners or computers called miners

71
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:49,383
 which we'll talk about today using computer power again 

72
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:56,117
But transactions were part of of that as as well as to how it comes together 

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm not going to torture you 

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,440
And I ask a bunch more 

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,340
But Diane

76
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,970
 one of the other important ideas is that even though solving the problem is really hard validating that the solution is corrected by 

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,727
So what this ensures is that even though miners are taking a lot of computing power to solve once the person has been sold

78
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:16,970
 it can be propagated to the most unvalidated 

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,460
So

80
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,970
 a key point that a giant

81
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,830
 a giant raises is that once somebody solves the puzzle

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,550
 it can be propagated across a network and then others on the network can validate it 

83
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,010
So what 

84
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,110
We'll talk about a little bit later is that it's a hard puzzle to solve

85
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,180
 but an easy puzzle to verify 

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,270
And this is an important asymmetry in essence

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,760
 that there's a lot of resources to solve a puzzle 

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,290
But once knowing the answer

89
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,410
 there's very limited resources to verify that it's the right answer is

90
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,950
 if it was not a symmetric

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,780
 it would not work as well 

92
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,710
So it's a key part of the design of many cryptographic things

93
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:18,470
 but particularly Adam backs sort of novelty in the 1990s of a proof of work 

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,150
I don't know if that's just a relaxed a bit for you or you have your hands up

95
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,870
 Derek 

96
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,590
That's just a relaxed pose 

97
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,860
I like it 

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,650
We're going to talk about other consensus protocols as well 

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,230
Proof of work is not the only consensus protocol

100
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:43,720
 but how to address ourselves to Byzantine fought tolerance and then some of the economic incentives 

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,590
So we'll talk about the native currency 

102
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,660
What's the native currency of the first blockchain application 

103
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,560
Bitcoin

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,080
 How many of you in this room owned a Bitcoin at some point in time 

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,130
So you've all owned the native currency that helps a blockchain 

106
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:12,100
You got the opportunity to read a paper that a group of us here at MIT coauthored

107
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,610
 I hope some of you actually were able to download it 

108
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:16,750
And then

109
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:17,830
 yeah

110
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,100
 go ahead 

111
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,250
Ahh

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,750
 apparently

113
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,010
 even when you write something

114
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,160
 it still goes behind a copyright wall 

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,910
So I'm glad to know that it was actually 

116
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:34,871
And then back to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Paper as well 

117
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:35,701
This time

118
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:42,342
 the next chapters and then a paper from about 25 years ago on the Byzantine

119
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,279
 general's problem

120
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,110
 it itself 

121
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,940
So what are we going to do today 

122
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,530
We're going to go back through the design 

123
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,310
We're going to talk about consensus through proof of work

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,140
 Bitcoin mining 

125
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,960
It's important

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,790
 it's relevant

127
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,560
 but it's kind of some fun facts about that as well 

128
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,070
The native currency

129
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,590
 of course

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,820
 Bitcoin of the first 

131
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,370
But there's now at least 1600 different native currencies 

132
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,500
What does it mean to have a network 

133
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,050
And why do networks matter

134
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,330
 particularly for blockchain

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,000
 some of the other consensus protocols

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,060
 and then just wrap up 

137
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,240
So just going back to the review 

138
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,610
And this is what we talked about a bit on Thursday 

139
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,840
But I think it's relevant to just kind of bring it back 

140
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,720
I found when I was first learning this

141
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,290
 it's hard to keep all the moving parts Remember

142
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,170
 There's how many so that graphic 

143
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,770
You'll see all semester 

144
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,300
But it's all the different blocks 

145
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,240
And it's a pen only 

146
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,020
What is a pen 

147
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,750
Only mean

148
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,460
 Andrew

149
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,750
 what it was that matter 

150
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,250
This word 

151
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,950
A pen only that we talked about last Thursday 

152
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,620
And so that's beautiful

153
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,180
 right 

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,590
So it's immutable now

155
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,250
 of course

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,030
 because cryptography maybe can be broken 

157
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,000
But we use the word immutable that it cannot be changed

158
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,040
 except for maybe as Elaine 

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,450
So I like

160
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,200
 that's in his book 

161
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,080
You all have to see this 

162
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,800
This is very clever 

163
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,290
You know

164
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,500
 a little in the standard of how to do a flag 

165
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,010
Maybe it's immutable except for one out of 10 to the 40th times 

166
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,610
It could be broken or something like can I interject and actually surveys 

167
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,960
It's not that good

168
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,130
 actually 

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,100
So technically

170
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,360
 Bitcoin and all of these permissions with their currencies

171
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,400
 one way to attack them is to combine

172
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,010
 get a lot of money and power in mind 

173
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,840
But another way to attract them is just take control over the actual network

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,780
 like the internet 

175
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,780
So if you're an internet service provider or through China

176
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,230
 you can actually cork Bitcoin with 0 mining power by just controlling the network 

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,390
So it's actually

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
 an assumption behind how this thing works

179
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,763
 which is that the network works because everybody sees the messages that I agree with you 

180
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:02,408
But there's also some assumptions 

181
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:07,110
Let's say that China or any state actor chose to fork

182
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,130
 one of these

183
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:21,883
 if it's considerably less than a majority you can focus your heights if you control the network 

184
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,762
If you control the worldwide network or just the network

185
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:25,914
 the actual internet 

186
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:26,681
I understand 

187
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:32,056
So are you talking about the worldwide internet or are you talking about why countries in China 

188
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,551
There's there's 50% of Chinese miners 

189
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:35,127
I'm China 

190
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:38,390
I forbid these Chinese miners to broadcast the blockchain 

191
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,750
They find the block goes here 

192
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,510
They find another block 

193
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,190
It goes here it goes 

194
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:42,480
Here it goes here 

195
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,620
And the rest of the world will find the block goes here 

196
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,020
And I have two forks goes here here 

197
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,600
And I have two forks 

198
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:48,750
2

199
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,060
 we don't see 

200
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,940
So we're gonna talk about forks a little later 

201
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,390
Can we hold a lean's point until that 

202
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,900
And then I'm going to share with you what Satoshi Nakamoto wrote about this very issue back in 2010

203
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,750
 and he was writing to your back where you have mining power 

204
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,400
He was assuming the network works out again

205
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,130
 just to clarify it 

206
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:20,670
Aleen's raising a point as to whether somebody captures part of the and if the internet itself by capturing part of the internet

207
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,270
 you fork 

208
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,040
The blockchain 

209
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,340
And what I was just said

210
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,360
 I would hold for later

211
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,160
 but instead

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,020
 I'll cover 

213
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:47,480
Now is this question was raised in an email exchange with whomever Satoshi Nakamoto was back in around 2010 and his his answer to Lean's question 

214
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,420
That I'm just helping share with you all 

215
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:00,050
Is that as long as is that part of the internet that was walled off was less than a majority 

216
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,830
And in fact

217
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,780
 if it was China

218
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,980
 because that was in the example even eight years ago

219
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,870
 it would be considered with less than 50% of that within a reasonable amount of time 

220
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,700
Maybe it would take a few hours

221
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,250
 but within a reasonable amount of time

222
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,130
 one chain would be

223
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,310
 where the majority of the mining power was and that

224
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:26,820
 that

225
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,680
 that it could take a while 

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,790
But the other one would would probably stop that 

227
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:39,630
People would stop investing electricity and CPU time within China because they would realize some way 

228
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,860
Now that was the theory

229
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,670
 at least 

230
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,210
And just get out on to that 

231
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,830
Something to realize is like if you

232
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,010
 I mean

233
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,560
 you said we'll go into forks

234
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,770
 but just people who don't know 1

235
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,360
 1

236
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,950
 4

237
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,270
 anything after that

238
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:54,870
 you go on hologram 

239
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,980
So it's like if you lose connection to the main Bitcoin network

240
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,009
 you still have that as long as you have your private keys 

241
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,422
So if somebody in China realizes that they're on the wrong chain

242
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:09,450
 it's not like you've lost your actual big one for they don't 

243
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,190
That's correct 

244
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,370
They don't want to lose it up to 

245
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,440
And what if I can use the term prior to the four 

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,140
Because a question 

247
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,010
Brutish

248
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,900
 so just to add to alliance point

249
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,230
 essentially 

250
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,151
So the way he says to be

251
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,631
 in fact

252
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:28,871
 yeah

253
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,792
 so to add to Adam's point

254
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,512
 actually 

255
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:31,753
So

256
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:37,035
 since the assumption underlying assumption for the president in general

257
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:45,679
 problem in the context of a blockchain is you have the assumption that the network can actually verify that the what is being

258
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,790
 to watch us over the network is actually a valid information 

259
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,830
So that is kind of an underlying assumption If the network is contaminated

260
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,610
 then the premise on which the problem is being solved or the or the protocol that is being

261
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,710
 given here as a solution to the problem is actually not valid

262
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,030
 if the network is

263
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,730
 on time network 

264
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,560
So that way it is indeed a so I think because I didn't pick up every word 

265
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,490
You're just saying that there is an underlying assumption that the network protocol

266
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,840
 the communication protocol of the internet is not compromised or walled off

267
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,180
 but also that it's working 

268
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:32,950
It creates a database we've talked about it through hash functions and digital signatures and then consensus 

269
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,490
So what were the technical features 

270
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,300
I thought about it a little bit from our last class to help just thinking through in three buckets

271
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,840
 the cryptography and time stamping that we talked about last Thursday 

272
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,940
What we're going to talk about today

273
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,090
 the decentralized consensus protocols and the network of course

274
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,190
 in the native currency 

275
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,980
And then lastly

276
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,100
 transaction script that we are going to talk about this coming Thursday 

277
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,770
Now

278
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,000
 it's not just three buckets because it's three lectures

279
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,750
 but it's 3 buckets because they have something to do with each other

280
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,900
 the cryptography

281
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,750
 which is at the core of cryptocurrencies and blockchains 

282
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,410
And it's just the core of a lot of things on the internet today 

283
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,240
And the consensus mechanism 

284
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,040
And then the transaction script itself 

285
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,000
Cryptography is

286
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,890
 as we've talked about communications in the presence of adversaries

287
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,580
 also a form of ways to make commitments 

288
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,591
And secure computation hash functions 

289
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,994
If you recall what we talked about

290
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,696
 what's the key 

291
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:50,880
Of of a hash function here joke in to keep your touch on one 

292
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
The elevator pitch 

293
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,020
You just have to

294
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,900
 you know

295
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,870
 make sure that your sibling knows 

296
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,230
What's it 

297
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,620
Do you have to the private and the public key

298
00:14:59,650 --> 00:14:59,970
 right 

299
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,280
That

300
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:00,590
 that

301
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,610
 that's a good

302
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,770
 that's cryptography

303
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,230
 but not a hash function 

304
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,870
It's a fingerprint of a fixed length of any amount of data 

305
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,770
I like that one way 

306
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,160
Data compression 

307
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,700
A crossword puzzle 

308
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,350
Anybody here do the New York Times crossword puzzle in a mobile app 

309
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:24,920
Good

310
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,430
 So if you do a Wednesday's New York Times crossword puzzle

311
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,500
 does it tell you whether you're correct on Wednesday or does it not tell you you're correct 

312
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:35,810
When

313
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,350
 when does it 

314
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,740
I don't do the New York Times crossword puzzles

315
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:38,890
 but I 

316
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,800
Aaron

317
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,510
 yeah

318
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,420
 I'm actually

319
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,800
 I usually do one in the past

320
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,750
 but I think it will tell you maybe either that day or the next day 

321
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,630
Or maybe

322
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:48,670
 I mean

323
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,020
 Stephanie

324
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,193
 so it tells you as soon as you finish the puzzle

325
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,590
 whether or not you have any errors 

326
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,960
But it won't 

327
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:02,000
But you can't actually check what the errors are unless you wanna like invalidate your streak for that day 

328
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,280
So basically

329
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,470
 you go to streak every time you go 

330
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,110
I don't actually know if the New York Times use hash functions

331
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,700
 but they could

332
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,250
 they could because they could stick the whole entire crossword puzzle into a hash function 

333
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
And it's a commitment scheme 

334
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,120
And remember if you change even one thing in the input data

335
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,070
 the hash will come out differently 

336
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,700
So the New York Times could use a hash function so that Stephanie could find out

337
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,070
 right 

338
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,910
Because you can only push to see if it's correct when you finish the whole 

339
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,340
And it either tells you have it or not

340
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,930
 right 

341
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,390
It's so I'm just

342
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,890
 I'm bringing it to real life that a hash function 

343
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,140
Just think of the New York Times crossword puzzle 

344
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,990
And if you don't remember

345
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,970
 ask Stephanie

346
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,590
 we talked about a pen

347
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,160
 only logs and recall that in blockchain and Bitcoin

348
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,530
 there's a bunch of information 

349
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,880
And the head of the block and that which is in the head of the block of 

350
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,350
Is put together like the New York Times crossword puzzle 

351
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,810
And we have a chain of blocks 

352
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,640
Most of the data

353
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:18,700
 though

354
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,280
 is stored efficiently in something called a Merkel tray 

355
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,230
Again

356
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,190
 it uses a whole lot of hash functions 

357
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,800
And so it's a way to be efficient 

358
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,390
But it's also a way to secure the data 

359
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,050
So now we're going to get back to your favorite thing

360
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,460
 Digital signatures 

361
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,850
So what's a digital signature deal 

362
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,230
You group 

363
00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:01,350
That you are signing something like a transaction with your private key and the other person on the other side could prove that you were the one designed it with your publication 

364
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,640
Perfect

365
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,360
 so it guards against tampering and impersonation 

366
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,810
I didn't go through this last Thursday

367
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,380
 but think of digital signatures 

368
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,460
Two different ways 

369
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,000
A digital signature that you use without a hash and in Bitcoin and blockchain often 

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
It's actually it's combined with a hash 

371
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,000
And so as Joe Quinn just went through

372
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:35,520
 you could have a private key that you sign something with the center's public key and a signature and exactly that 

373
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,520
But it's also able to do it where you have a hash as well 

374
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,710
You take all the data

375
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,850
 all the message that you put it into into it with a signature 

376
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,700
And

377
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,710
 this is a little bit too complex 

378
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,310
And it was last Thursday's lecture 

379
00:18:52,310 --> 00:19:00,350
But it's important to know that what blockchain is basically doing most blockchains do is they take a lot of information

380
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,720
 a transaction

381
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,550
 for instance

382
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,890
 and hash that information 

383
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,980
And why do we hash it again

384
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,410
 Kelly

385
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,900
 to protect it from other 

386
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,730
Sort of like we have awesome Bob

387
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,010
 how one has to be aware of each other's key and then verify the incoming 

388
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,887
And it

389
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:25,857
 it also compresses some of the data 

390
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:26,295
But it's

391
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,046
 it's a commitment scheme 

392
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:28,703
It's like

393
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:29,360
 this is it 

394
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,810
This is actually the New York Times crossword puzzle that answers all the questions 

395
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,590
So usually it first hashes it

396
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,860
 meaning it's a commitment and then put a digital signature on it 

397
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,100
And there was one last thing we talked about last week 

398
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,850
What are Bitcoin addresses 

399
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,900
Isabella

400
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,170
 can you tell me what a Bitcoin address is 

401
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:04,820
I guess

402
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,430
 tell me where the Bitcoins can be sent 

403
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,380
So it tells you where Bitcoin is being said 

404
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:10,710
Ben

405
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,890
 you want to help out a little 

406
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,540
So it's the 

407
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,070
Public key

408
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,740
 public cashier 

409
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,610
So it's closed 

410
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,065
So it's basically that between Isabel and Ben

411
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,366
 you've got it 

412
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,017
It it 

413
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:33,851
It's basically how any of the native currency Bitcoin can be identified

414
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:44,630
 but it is a public key with a couple extra hashes and a little bit other fancy footwork to make it compressed and smaller 

415
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,150
But it is literally what the

416
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,340
 you can send bitcoins to 

417
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,540
So it's determined by the public key 

418
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,830
But it's not identical to 

419
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,390
And I found a fancy little chart chart to define it 

420
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,930
A private key leads to a public key 

421
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,610
Through some form and in Bitcoin

422
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,930
 it's called elliptic curve multiplication 

423
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,200
But there are other forms of public and private keys 

424
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,380
The public key 

425
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,610
Then it gets hashed 

426
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,540
And then it goes through a code that makes it shorter

427
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,820
 which is the Bitcoin address part of the reason it was hashed 

428
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,120
And part of the reason it goes through that extra code is to make it even more secure for

429
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,160
 it's not the only reason it also compresses it a bit more

430
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,570
 but those of you who have ever owned Bitcoin

431
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,840
 you have a wallet and the wallet keeps those Bitcoin addresses 

432
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,200
All right

433
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,580
 so now let's talk about decentralized networks 

434
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,540
The topic of today

435
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:49,970
 Sil ver 

436
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,030
Any questions about the review for last Thursday 

437
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,120
I know it was quick a lot 

438
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,440
I've always been about double hash part 

439
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,230
Does that mean that it's now less invisible to be 

440
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,633
And like the last immutable 

441
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:06,028
Because if you take a 21st digit

442
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,550
 cash and you contract it to a or digit 

443
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,360
A few other options 

444
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,110
I think that your

445
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,920
 the question is

446
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,450
 is this

447
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,210
 if the output of a hash function is shorter

448
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,840
 is it possibly can more breakable 

449
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,010
I think mathematically that might be correct 

450
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,070
However

451
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,810
 this actually goes through two hashes

452
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,610
 one

453
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,040
 which is this mechanism called Shah 2 56 and the other one 

454
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm going to mispronounce 

455
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,640
But down to 1 60 

456
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,790
So I think because it's going through two different hashes 

457
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,790
The answer is it's even harder to break both that 

458
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,970
Any other questions about the review now

459
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,810
 please

460
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,390
 Derek 

461
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,290
So he said

462
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,610
 hashing the public key makes it more secure 

463
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,870
I'm just wondering

464
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,790
 cause like the public key is for the public

465
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,090
 right 

466
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,380
So like

467
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,050
 what is the

468
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,390
 where does the audit security come up 

469
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,690
So the only thing that you're actually

470
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,010
 showing is a Bitcoin address until later 

471
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,980
And we'll talk a lot about this on Thursday when you actually do a transaction

472
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,730
 you have to do

473
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,050
 then disclose your public key 

474
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,490
So initially

475
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:38,740
 the storage is around Bitcoin addresses and some will advise 

476
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,270
And it's why many wallets do this that you should never use the same public key twice

477
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,460
 though numerous people do in blockchains

478
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,630
 but to be most secure

479
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,100
 you would constantly be creating new public key 

480
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,560
Private key pairs are 

481
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,970
And once you've used it

482
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,530
 move on and get a new Philip Keys 

483
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,740
Got it 

484
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,530
So distributed networks 

485
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,230
We talked about Byzantine generals problem 

486
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,290
So I found some Byzantine generals and they want to all attack that cat 

487
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,150
Castle 

488
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,360
Or what if only three of them do 

489
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,860
And two of them say retreat

490
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,680
 that that's the visual 

491
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,050
That's

492
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,810
 that's the problem 

493
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,860
The only way to win it in this mathematical game theory paper that was written some 25 years ago

494
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,540
 as if they all said attack or all said retreat 

495
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,230
But the same thing sort of came to computers 

496
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,930
And the core thing about a permissionless system is there is no central authority 

497
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,100
And if there is no central authority

498
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:59,050
 had as a distributed network like the distributed set of generals come to some agreement

499
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,510
 do we attack 

500
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,530
Do we retreat 

501
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,060
Well

502
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,410
 it's based on a consensus protocol and a native currency

503
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,210
 though

504
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,060
 that's the key 

505
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,130
Innovation of Satoshi Nakamoto is to pull it all together 

506
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,910
But it was built on the backs of other people 

507
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,970
Adam

508
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,990
 back in 1997

509
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,380
 he proposed a way to address email

510
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,080
 spam

511
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,170
 and other types of computer problems called denial service attacks 

512
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,650
Now it ultimately wasn't used 

513
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,850
I mean

514
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,660
 he proposed it 

515
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,430
It was used for a short while and then it wasn't subsequently used

516
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,370
 but it's important to understand that the proof of work in the middle of Bitcoin was

517
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,680
 created 11 or 12 years before the Bitcoin paper 

518
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:02,810
And the key was basically require a bunch of computational work using hash functions 

519
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,560
And so the email or the header of the email

520
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,660
 this is Adam backs

521
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,690
 not Bitcoin

522
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,670
 but the email or the header of the email

523
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,660
 went into the hash function creates a hash 

524
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,710
But the difficulty of finding whether it's confirmed was

525
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,970
 was it in a certain range of hashes 

526
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,660
And he did that by the quote leading zeros 

527
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:39,690
Does anybody want to guess why he did it this way Or or Orleans just going to tell us probably and not guess 

528
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,270
But who hasn't spoken yet 

529
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,870
Emily

530
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,750
 you want to try it out 

531
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,770
I'm not totally sure

532
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:51,860
 Daniel 

533
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:58,550
And move on just just like preserve some privacy around the emails 

534
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,150
Well

535
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,950
 so it definitely preserved privacy 

536
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,840
But he was trying to put some computational work 

537
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:13,865
Every email that would set be set would take one to 2 or three seconds of computational work that that was his in his original paper 

538
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,520
It would take a few seconds 

539
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,450
The fact

540
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:28,210
 the fact that we earlier we were talking about the fact that we need a way in which we to make the puzzles

541
00:27:29,312 --> 00:27:30,884
 difficult to solve

542
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:32,456
 but easy to validate 

543
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:36,910
This is exactly how the whole thing is accomplished by

544
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,130
 setting the hash into a fixed characteristic

545
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:52,340
 like leading a number of giving zeros to what you get is to modify a small piece of all the information and try and try until you get that specific hash 

546
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,600
And that makes it really computational intensive 

547
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,800
But validating is just running one 

548
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,130
And I have some 

549
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,110
Here

550
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,240
 Bill

551
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,075
 I mean

552
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:07,100
 it comes back to what we talked about last time with the nances 

553
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:13,650
You need to try out a bunch of different random numbers in order to get the right number of leading zeros 

554
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,654
And it could be

555
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:15,657
 I don't know 

556
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:18,266
I think it could be like leading anything

557
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,800
 but he chose zero cuz it's nice

558
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:20,900
 right 

559
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,020
But like you need to try to like move around numbers in order to get the right number of 

560
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,440
And in the email circumstance

561
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:34,055
 his thought was it will take two or three seconds for anyone sending an email to do this proof of work 

562
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:37,380
But it will take a nanosecond or less to confirm it it 

563
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:45,010
But if you were sending spam and you had a computers who said millions of spam times two or three seconds apiece

564
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,010
 that would be too much for the spammer 

565
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,940
That that was it 

566
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,300
So any one

567
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,850
 any person sending one email

568
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,290
 it won't be too bad 

569
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,970
Anyone sending millions of emails 

570
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,380
It would be lousy 

571
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,210
And so that's why this concept was in the midst of emails 

572
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,830
And it could be efficiently proved 

573
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,510
So back to blockchain

574
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,330
 the innovation was basically

575
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,260
 how do we do this with a chain 

576
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,610
How do we do this with a chain set of works 

577
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,030
And remember Stuart Haber

578
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,920
 that whole thing about the blockchain and the that 

579
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,270
What's in the New York times this was

580
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,950
 was that chain of information 

581
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,410
But here

582
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,670
 why don't we do a proof of work between the chain 

583
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
And I found a little graphic 

584
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,610
But

585
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,700
 but the Shah 2 56

586
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,380
 that's the formula which is is used to hash the header

587
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,390
 the previous hash

588
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,150
 the transaction hash

589
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,850
 a time stamp

590
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,480
 and a knots 

591
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,560
Can you find a hash that has a certain number of leading zeros 

592
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,510
This was the key innovation

593
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,080
 in a sense 

594
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:04,630
Or maybe Satoshi Nakamoto was just taking Adam Beck's email proof of work 

595
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
Remember the reading for last week 

596
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,170
A blocks this

597
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,360
 this is colored green because each of them have hashes that

598
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,210
 in this case have leading 

599
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,990
If I'm right

600
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,010
 is this it leading 4 zeros and leading four zeros 

601
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,760
What if we change one thing 

602
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,630
What's going to happen 

603
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,660
Is it alpha 

604
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,100
What 

605
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,110
What happens if we change one thing 

606
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,540
The hash will change completely 

607
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,170
The hash will change completely 

608
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,850
So what happened 

609
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,570
What did we change here 

610
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,770
I'll go back and forth 

611
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,350
You change the pull up 

612
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,820
What's that

613
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,520
 Zad 

614
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,830
You changed the point of use transaction 

615
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,360
So that's hundred dollars

616
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,440
 I guess in this example went to you instead of anger 

617
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:06,658
Well

618
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,075
 I why

619
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:07,283
 why 

620
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,410
Why should I be able to get 100 dollars for free 

621
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,619
Well

622
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,453
 in this example

623
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,954
 I guess the Coinbase is for the miner

624
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:14,371
 right 

625
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:19,375
So there is one transaction dedicated for whoever validates the block gets right 

626
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,000
Right now

627
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,042
 12

628
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:21,459
5 Bitcoin 

629
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:26,463
And so you add that in addition to all the other transactions that you're validating 

630
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,297
But in this case

631
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:29,173
 you're not actually this minor 

632
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:29,381
So

633
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:29,798
 you know

634
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,466
 shouldn't be getting that much 

635
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:36,052
So the little 18 minute video of it was assigned for last Thursday 

636
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:38,137
I just went in and I was trying to

637
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,388
 I was trying to get

638
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,890
 I was trying to get the money for me 

639
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,080
And it

640
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,890
 it invalidated the rest of the chain 

641
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,140
And that's really

642
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,920
 that's the

643
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,410
 that's the sort of innovation or genius is

644
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,000
 is if you try to go into a former block

645
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:07,510
 whether it's the last block or block 100000 blocks away and change one little whisker of information or one letter on that crossword puzzle

646
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,440
 it's going to change the entire blockchain 

647
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,800
And I bring it back to the crossword puzzles or a whisker on a cat 

648
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,550
It's just any little bit of information about 

649
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:30,910
So an innovation about hash functions became an innovation about timestamp and blocks 

650
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,180
All of a sudden came with this proof of work innovation 

651
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,340
So now to the chains themselves

652
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,280
 The consensus of blockchains and many people would say that

653
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,770
 in fact

654
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:54,580
 the reality of blockchain is only the longest chain is the one that other miners

655
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,770
 other people will build a pot 

656
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,730
As I understand

657
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:58,840
 though

658
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,540
 it's not written into the base computational code

659
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,660
 it's really just a consensus that comes about This is an example

660
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,590
 the purple block and the black blocks are

661
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,390
 the purple blocks are kind of stale blocks 

662
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,520
They were mined 

663
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,640
They were computationally solved 

664
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,670
A proof of work

665
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,380
 but nobody mined on top of them 

666
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,100
And if somebody doesn't mind on top of them

667
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,810
 then eventually

668
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,110
 they're ignored some people call orphan blocks 

669
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,190
But I'll call them stale blocks because they were actually created

670
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,650
 but the information that's in them are is kind of worthless 

671
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,390
It's not needed in the actual Bitcoin technology 

672
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,050
This happens from time to time

673
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,010
 but it hasn't happened in over a year 

674
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,700
The technology

675
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,310
 it's and you can look on various websites to find this out 

676
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,760
Probably at the maximum

677
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,400
 the longest stale chain 

678
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,240
Get it out to two or three blocks 

679
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,560
But it's very

680
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,780
 very rare 

681
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,720
So back to Lean's question

682
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,120
 what if China carved off and had 

683
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,360
The presumption 

684
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,630
It may not work

685
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,950
 but the presumption is

686
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:36,090
 let's say China is the purple blocks because China's wat off its entire network is the presumption is there'll be some communication outside of the network 

687
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,510
It might be on television 

688
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:45,660
It might be by courier that the Chinese miners would know that they're not in the majority

689
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:56,570
 and they would stop expending electricity to even mine in that circumstance is because whether it's a few hours or a few weeks or a few months

690
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,000
 they know that their expenditures would be like

691
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,090
 be worthless 

692
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,870
Tom and these sale wax 

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,800
These four blocks are the miners receiving Bitcoins 

694
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,100
So in the purple blocks

695
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,990
 there will be if I can go back to this

696
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,250
 there will be a Coinbase transaction 

697
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:35,760
But it will be worthless because it's a Coinbase transaction and a block that's not on the main block 

698
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,730
And it won't be usable later 

699
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,010
But in Bitcoin itself

700
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,380
 there's software that says you cannot use a Coinbase 

701
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,320
They output for 100 blocks 

702
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,780
It's written right into the base code 

703
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,640
And it has been since the beginning 

704
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,615
So we do not verify

705
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:01,140
 though

706
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,402
 that 

707
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:05,340
So in the situation where network is walled off

708
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:13,980
 people start mining on top of this segmented block when they not realize that their Bitcoins are invalid for 100 years 

709
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,550
Hey

710
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,670
 say save for some external now

711
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,750
 yes 

712
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,830
Let me just go back to the

713
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,440
 sorry

714
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,200
 the chain 

715
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,070
You're saying that the Tom's question is

716
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,420
 is what if the purple side chain goes on for 100 blocks 

717
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,220
What happens 

718
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,860
And in fact

719
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,610
 we have circumstances of that 

720
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,040
Bitcoin has split between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash 

721
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,585
It was called a hard fork last year and for a moment

722
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:51,470
 let's call the purple chain Bitcoin cache 

723
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,800
It's not only gone on for hundred blocks

724
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,790
 it's now gone on for tens of thousands of blocks 

725
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,380
It is now its own native currency within that community

726
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:12,230
 That purple blockchain is so long now that people have found value in that and it is its own native currency 

727
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,440
And the reason I share that is to Tom's question of

728
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,560
 well

729
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,210
 what if China was walled off so long 

730
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,930
It's plausible

731
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,150
 unlikely

732
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,100
 but plausible

733
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:31,690
 that there would become some value and call it the Bitcoin China blockchain versus the Bitcoin global blockchain 

734
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,280
It would be as what is money

735
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,900
 but a social consensus 

736
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,840
So who goes beside the award 

737
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,220
I mean

738
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,350
 as it fades into the amount for a top there

739
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,490
 I think the other question that I

740
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,350
 who decides it 

741
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,540
So is it supporting the man music community 

742
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,830
And what is the form of being 

743
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,050
The question is of the reward 

744
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,510
I'm going to hold a part of part of it for a little bit when we talk about native currency

745
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:11,123
 but the reward is in nearly every blockchain is

746
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:15,505
 is a new native currency of that blockchain 

747
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:17,190
Bitcoin for Bitcoin

748
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,898
 F or ETH for if the Ethereum

749
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,070
 XRP

750
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,520
 or for each blockchain

751
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,600
 there's a native currency 

752
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,450
Who the second question was

753
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,630
 who decides it 

754
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,740
It's generally

755
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,620
 but not always hard programmed into the first release 

756
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,230
Of that blockchain 

757
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:41,916
Yeah

758
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,812
 so back to a question on back to the question on a Bitcoin

759
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:46,895
 a Bitcoin cash gift

760
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:48,843
 The Bitcoin cash is the purple line 

761
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:49,492
If you see

762
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:50,791
 on the channel here

763
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:54,038
 does that mean cause it's shorter compared to the block 

764
00:38:54,254 --> 00:38:55,120
Bitcoin chain 

765
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,636
Does that make the under the

766
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,151
 the assumption of the

767
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,099
 the majority consensus

768
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,181
 the value of

769
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,130
 which is essentially the real 

770
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,800
The question is

771
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,470
 is

772
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,830
 is if it's shorter

773
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,840
 does it 

774
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,280
So there's no

775
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,060
 there was

776
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,742
 there's no validity in that in that chain and they'll put it down 

777
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:17,002
So

778
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:17,782
 so there's

779
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:18,562
 there's two

780
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,684
 in using this chart just as an example

781
00:39:21,684 --> 00:39:22,724
 there's two ways

782
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:28,186
 there was the main point of this chart was to say that the black

783
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,486
 the black chain

784
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:31,567
 as represented in black

785
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:32,867
 is the main chain 

786
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:36,249
And that is where the social consensus will stay 

787
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,590
That's where the consensus is 

788
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,860
And generally speaking

789
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,300
 the stale blocks don't mean anything 

790
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,850
And the stale blocks go away 

791
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:53,520
And occasionally there is something called a hard fork where the social consensus continues to maintain 

792
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:03,640
And I was using this chart as a rough answer to Tom's earlier question about Bitcoin cash 

793
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,460
And if the purple chain kept going for thousands of blocks 

794
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,310
And there was a social consensus to keep both chains going

795
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,460
 you'd start to see separate

796
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,490
 currencies 

797
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,150
And as you have seen with Bitcoin cash

798
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,860
 does that help 

799
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,020
So I was

800
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,710
 I was using a graphic to answer a separate question 

801
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,260
I'm going to take two more questions and then go to native currencies 

802
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,720
I haven't heard from Daniel yet 

803
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,120
What a question is similar to the mining 

804
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,650
So if your transaction is on one of the purple box

805
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,820
 does that transaction boy

806
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,892
 so is the it's not so much void 

807
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:42,395
It's just

808
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,654
 it's meaningless 

809
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:43,905
It's

810
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:44,157
 yes

811
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:45,164
 in a sense 

812
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:46,675
Effectively it's void 

813
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,688
So I guess with somebody

814
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:51,206
 if you initiated that transaction

815
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,220
 would you be aware of it 

816
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,230
And reinitiated 

817
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,490
Very good question 

818
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,550
The transactions 

819
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,010
Will

820
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,680
 still be in what's called the memory pool of anybody who's mining on the on the main chain 

821
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,450
So transactions

822
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,900
 which we'll talk a lot about on Thursday is coming lecture 

823
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,900
Go in through the network 

824
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,940
They're propagated through the network to the entire node network 

825
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,530
And Bitcoin

826
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,900
 There's about 10000 nodes 

827
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,800
And they will receive those coins 

828
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,140
And those two

829
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 those proposed transactions 

830
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,820
So anything in the purple chain will still be in the other chains 

831
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,910
Memory pool

832
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:38,668
 1

833
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,100
 1 more than I went in 

834
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,423
You can make use of the hot name 

835
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:42,679
Yes

836
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:42,934
 yes

837
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:43,190
 yes 

838
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,152
In the case of the heart post 

839
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:46,785
So between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash

840
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:48,054
 what are the differences 

841
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:48,236
And

842
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:51,320
 whatever the differences in value between those two 

843
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,920
That's a much longer question 

844
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,740
And the question is

845
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,130
 is what are the differences of value between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash 

846
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,660
And though

847
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:08,050
 I think Bitcoin is trading around $6300 and Bitcoin cash is what

848
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,007
 4

849
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:12,046
 3435 

850
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:13,060
Thank you

851
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,397
 Zan 

852
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,112
That gives you the monetary

853
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:21,164
 difference of about 15 to 1 

854
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,180
But it would take more conversations about why that happened in background and so forth 

855
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,490
So let me

856
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,170
 let me

857
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,180
 talk about the difficulty factor 

858
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,610
So proof of work

859
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:42,990
 at least in Bitcoins cays has a difficulty factor with regard to these leading zeros in the hash 

860
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,970
And Satoshi Nakomoto said

861
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,580
 let's change that every 10 minutes 

862
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,070
Let's ensure that every block comes on average every 10 minutes 

863
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,940
And to do that

864
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:03,050
 define how many leading zeros there needs to be 

865
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,730
And it had just about every two weeks 

866
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,060
Every blockchain can be different 

867
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,190
It doesn't have to adjust every two weeks 

868
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,120
This is just what Bitcoin did 

869
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,790
This is what Nakamura did to maintain an average of 10 minutes 

870
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:21,910
So what 

871
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,650
What has happened 

872
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,230
Currently 

873
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,450
It takes 18 leading zeros 

874
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,430
And because this is in a 60

875
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,520
 it's in a hexadecimal character system 

876
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,080
Every decimal it is 

877
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,911
What's that in 4 b 

878
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:41,782
So it's 61st

879
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,525
 maybe zeros and bits 

880
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:45,559
And 18 in Exodus

881
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,140
 Is it 

882
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,560
So it's 2 to the 64th 

883
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,130
The probability of finding a block is one over two to the -6 

884
00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:03,830
So what Eileen just said was that it's a very small chance of finding a block because this is the equivalent of 18 leading zeros 

885
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,250
So it's more than 64 

886
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,250
It's 18 times 4 

887
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:08,740
Oh

888
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:08,790
 that's

889
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,110
 yeah

890
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:09,280
 No

891
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,690
 sorry

892
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,780
 I can't do it with present with it 

893
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:11,830
Ya

894
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,180
 ya

895
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,580
 his Phd in computer science

896
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,550
 but can't do arithmetic 

897
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,490
So this is the most recent block I grabbed off the blockchain this morning 

898
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,030
And it has 18 leading zeros 

899
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,730
And then all those other digits

900
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,980
 that's block number 541974

901
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,890
 18 leading zeros

902
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,850
 the Genesis block

903
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,740
 the very first block in January 2009 had 10 

904
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,870
Leading zeros are

905
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:51,700
 but the requirement that Satoshi Nakamoto actually put into the computer code was you only needed 8 leading zeroes 

906
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,510
So the probabilities have gone way up 

907
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,150
So let me take it off of a fancy

908
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,460
 you know

909
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,620
 numbers like that 

910
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:07,170
And just say this is the actual Bitcoin mining difficulties on a logarithmic scale because if it weren't logarithmic

911
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,580
 you couldn't really read it 

912
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:08,650
And it

913
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,940
 the difficulty was set at one 

914
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,710
This is all scaled to 

915
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,580
How difficult was it for the first year and a half of mining in 2009 in early 2010

916
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,380
 100 

917
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:27,070
And now it is at 1 trillion 

918
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,260
It's actually more than 1 trillion because it's logarithmic 

919
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,040
It's at about 7 trillion 

920
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:43,340
It is currently 7 trillion times harder to find the answer to the puzzle than it was in 2009 

921
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,920
And that's because there's a lot of computers trying to hash all of this stuff 

922
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,563
Yeah

923
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:57,458
 so is that where the collectors are 

924
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:03,290
The pools of mining nodes work to be able to more efficient

925
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,270
 correct

926
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,130
 correct 

927
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,330
And the hash rate is now somewhere around 

928
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,380
50

929
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,835
 it's not Terra hash is i'm trying to remember what the

930
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:23,020
 what's at 50 hexa hash per second

931
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:31,620
 which is like 1000 trillion hashes because a Tara hashes a trillion hashes 

932
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,260
Zan

933
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,600
 I think it's worth noting

934
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:33,620
 though

935
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,290
 it it didn't scale linearly as like number of computers got on the network 

936
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,810
It's also the hardware has gotten incredibly more sophisticated 

937
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,820
So it's not that you can just assume there is

938
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:45,180
 you know

939
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,200
 15 trillion number of people that are mining Bitcoin 

940
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,070
It's just the same people that are doing it better 

941
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,790
I can't ask for a better setup than that 

942
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,630
Bitcoin mining evolution did you 

943
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,300
Did you see my slides 

944
00:46:59,220 --> 00:46:59,810
And you know

945
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:00,800
 so what 

946
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:01,830
What's the evolution 

947
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,060
So it started with central processing units and Cpus 

948
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:12,880
And I'm not sure my numbers are accurate because I might be using Cpu power today and not Cpu power in twenty O nine 

949
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:16,460
Apologies for those who know CPU power better than mine 

950
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:23,290
You could do about 2 to 20 million hashes a second on a CPU properly geared

951
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:23,590
 apparently

952
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:23,940
 I think 

953
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,230
They didn't last that long by 2010 

954
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,540
Some folks figured out there was something faster and it was called the

955
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,550
 a graphics processing unit 

956
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,460
We all use Gpus all day long because that's what gives us all our quick graphics 

957
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,080
If you live stream something that on your laptop and graphics processing units

958
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,020
 somebody figured out you can use that and you could hash faster 

959
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,200
And then all of a sudden

960
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,200
 hobbyists started to wire the Gpus together 

961
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,160
And they could figure out a way to get between 20 million hashes to 300 million hashes 

962
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,900
A second

963
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:11,890
 I'm told that even today you could maybe get up closer to 1000 million hash is a second or a billion hash is a second 

964
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,160
If you did a GPU rig 

965
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,720
But that's yesteryear on Bitcoin 

966
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,850
Now there's something called an application specific integrated circuit

967
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,020
 an ASIC 

968
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:31,210
Just think about a circuit that the only thing the circuit does is create hashes for 

969
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,290
In fact

970
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,040
 the circuit is wired 

971
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,720
I use the word wired because I'm old enough to remember wires

972
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:52,320
 but it's the circuit board is manufactured in a way that all it does is the Shah 2 56 hash function to bit quite mine 

973
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,010
And the first A six

974
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,540
 which are dedicated circuit boards 

975
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,050
To do this

976
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,400
 mining came out in 2013

977
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,660
 and even since then

978
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:12,440
 they have moved up the scale the most expensive that sells for about 3 or $4000 in Asac can do 16 terra hashes per second

979
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,420
 or at least that's what it's rated for 

980
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,010
If you go on Amazon and try to buy it and you could do that you

981
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,150
 but you'd be competing with something like that looks like this 

982
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:31,380
A modern mining factory for Bitcoin has thousands of Asics 

983
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,560
They have water cooling systems to keep it cooled

984
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,310
 and they're probably buying their electricity for less than 3 kW

985
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,790
 3 cents per kilowatt 

986
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:53,130
And they might even be paying off the local government officials and not even paying the electricity company and just bribing to get their electricity 

987
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,760
Emily

988
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,070
 double question 

989
00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:01,260
But in terms of like an economic opportunity cost using all this processing power just for mining Bitcoin

990
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,390
 like is there a more efficient allocation of that processing capability in terms of like a more

991
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,730
 a more stable economic usage 

992
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,460
There are certainly tradeoffs here 

993
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:17,040
And the aggregate electricity for all of Bitcoin mining 

994
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,860
Now that it's 7 trillion times harder than it was in 2009

995
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,790
 has been compared to the electricity use of countries like Ireland along the way to the electricity use of countries like Denmark 

996
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,750
I think it's somewhere between Ireland and Denmark 

997
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,290
See

998
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:34,860
 Larry

999
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,780
 a lot of that 

1000
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:51,490
The cost is make less assuming $10 or whatever he had currency and the reward is in Bitcoin volatility of Bitcoin makes it hard to answer that question because you don't know if there is an economy

1001
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:56,680
 value for you because you don't have a little bit more 

1002
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,561
So I said in our first class

1003
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:04,013
 I'm neither a blockchain maximist or blockchain minimalist 

1004
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:08,990
And you all will have a chance through this course to form your own views 

1005
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,620
But one of the debates is all right

1006
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,290
 The Emily's debate is this a good use of economic 

1007
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,940
A good use of resources 

1008
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,860
But I would note that all

1009
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,750
 strong currencies

1010
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:32,860
 strong monies for centuries have had something to limit the supply 

1011
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,790
And so now we're doing it electronically 

1012
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,490
And through this mining

1013
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,352
 it doesn't mean it's the best use 

1014
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:42,774
I'm just saying it's another way 

1015
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:46,710
So extracting gold out of the ground is very hard 

1016
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,526
And in the 19th century

1017
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:55,490
 to have big vault doors and security guards with rifles was a way to insure it 

1018
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,350
And one could even say that a having central banks takes cost 

1019
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:10,540
So I think of it as as a tradeoff of how you ensure a currency is a harder currency to create 

1020
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,940
But it doesn't mean that proof of work is the best way

1021
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:14,890
 which is

1022
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,300
 of course

1023
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,740
 then the setup to

1024
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,640
 the question of are there other ways to do consensus 

1025
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,550
So one other thing is all of this hashing

1026
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,920
 How is it distributed 

1027
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,370
And this I pulled off the internet this morning 

1028
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,780
You can see these statistics every day

1029
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,240
 Proof of work and mining has

1030
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,550
 formed mining pools 

1031
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:53,330
And these mining pools come together for simple economic reason that it's so unlikely to solve the riddle 

1032
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,320
Solve the puzzle of mining 

1033
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,640
And that if you can only solve it once a year

1034
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,160
 or maybe even once every 10 years

1035
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,950
 you weren't going to invest in mining 

1036
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:11,180
So mining pools started around 2010 to smooth out the revenue 

1037
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,440
So if Amanda doesn't want to get it once every 10 years

1038
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,100
 she might say

1039
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,130
 well

1040
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,130
 why doesn't all the 80 people in this room 

1041
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,210
You might

1042
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,650
 Amanda

1043
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,400
 I don't know

1044
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,960
 say why don't we all form a pool 

1045
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,910
And we'll are going to use our laptops 

1046
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:34,460
And now this is still 2009 or 2010 when you can mind Bitcoin on your laptop 

1047
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,950
But we could say

1048
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,020
 why don't we all do that together 

1049
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,560
And then all of us could say

1050
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:39,710
 well

1051
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,170
 Amanda

1052
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,470
 that's a bright idea 

1053
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:47,290
But could you create the Merkel route for us 

1054
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,490
Could you do some other things so that our computer doesn't have to do all that other fancy stuff 

1055
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,080
So then Amanda might say

1056
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:55,220
 well

1057
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,450
 I want to charge all of you a little bit 

1058
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:06,020
How about if I charge you 1% of the take and a man who would call herself a mining pool operator 

1059
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:26,930
That's what's happened is basically the economics of mining have clumped around mining pool operators and the standard fees range from 1 to 3% that the mining pool operator provides a number of services to the miners themselves

1060
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,900
 and those services are compensated

1061
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,610
 as I say

1062
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,110
 somewhere between 1 and 3% of the returns 

1063
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,760
But mostly it smooths out the economics for all the miners 

1064
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:36,850
It 

1065
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,710
It does some other things as well 

1066
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,270
But that's the primary 

1067
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:41,870
Sorry

1068
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,190
 I also had one question there because then you laid out the difficulty of mining has become increasingly difficult

1069
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,090
 and the cost of the electricity rate

1070
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:56,090
 the breakeven for the breakeven point has actually becoming a lower and lower in terms of electricity cost 

1071
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,220
So with that in mind

1072
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,490
 over the next couple of years

1073
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,770
 if that's the case

1074
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,880
 people will start to lose incentive and keep it doing the mining 

1075
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,520
And once that happened

1076
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,750
 once that happened to audio

1077
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,450
 well

1078
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,320
 it could go either way 

1079
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,230
As we said

1080
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,870
 just Bitcoin

1081
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:20,570
 this is Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty of mining every two weeks 

1082
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,910
So if there is fewer people mining

1083
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,430
 the difficulty will go down 

1084
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:25,630
And if you remember

1085
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,100
 I said you had to have 18 leading zeros

1086
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:33,330
 it might go back to 17 leading zeros or 16 leading zeros 

1087
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:41,600
And every two weeks it adjusts based upon the prior 2016 blocks 

1088
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,910
Did it average 10 minutes 

1089
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:44,830
If it averaged

1090
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,800
 for instance

1091
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,320
 14 minutes

1092
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:51,800
 then it will lower the difficulty if it averages 6 minutes

1093
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,620
 it will increase the difficulty 

1094
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,390
Kelly

1095
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,880
 is this for the steak comes in like

1096
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:07,500
 does BTC always get their 19% because they have the largest stake in the system 

1097
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,780
And so Kelly is asking whether this is where proof of steak comes in 

1098
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,760
What is proof of steak 

1099
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,690
Anybody who read the Coindesk article

1100
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,450
 see when you hide your first name

1101
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,560
 I can just call your US Air Force 

1102
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,600
That it's true 

1103
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,110
Bose Bo's name Cart says US Air Force 

1104
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:28,910
That's true 

1105
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,400
So proof of stake is the coins 

1106
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,470
All the coins are dispersed 

1107
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:41,650
And the verification allocation is allocate how to place it 

1108
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,470
So proof of stake is an alternative consensus mechanism 

1109
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,560
And Bo described it well

1110
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,390
 But Kelly

1111
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,890
 it's not related to this chart here 

1112
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,750
This is all proof of work 

1113
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:11,250
BTC has 19% of the hash rate that that means that they literally have about if the total hash power on Bitcoin is 60 Hexa 

1114
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,560
Do I have this word 

1115
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:13,010
Heck

1116
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,090
 substance exa hash

1117
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,150
 then 19% of that are about 12 

1118
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,070
I'm going to do 

1119
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,300
That's not the stake that they already correct 

1120
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,030
Most Bitcoin miners sell their coins 

1121
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:41,220
So the coins that are created the coins that are created each year are sold into the a broad

1122
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,370
 very few miners 

1123
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:48,140
Hold on to their coins for great lengths of time 

1124
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,460
I mean

1125
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,740
 they might for days they might

1126
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:50,990
 for

1127
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,600
 they might keep some for all sorts of reasons 

1128
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,760
And as I truly believe

1129
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:12,535
 but can't factually prove a number of of the biggest mining pools or miners are in places where they're doing illicit activity they're getting their electricity for less than what it's really costing on the grid 

1130
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:13,587
By bad act

1131
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:13,850
 actor 

1132
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,660
But nonetheless

1133
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:22,140
 they have a choice whether to sell their coins or keep their coins a question over here 

1134
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,310
And then I wanna keep going 

1135
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,950
If if the mining industry is like so formalized like you've got so many pools

1136
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,030
 what prevents all the pools from coming together and saying that

1137
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,680
 let's just like sort of lesser puzzle 

1138
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,390
So the difficulty becomes lower 

1139
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,210
And then the charge is much lower to each and everyone 

1140
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,700
So the question is

1141
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,050
 is

1142
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:47,380
 is what happens if the mining pools collude and come together either as a giant says to

1143
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,030
 let's say

1144
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,290
 well

1145
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:57,070
 why should we have a good so much mining capacity lets as a cartel like OPEC

1146
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:02,380
 the oil cartel say we should constrain supply and so forth 

1147
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,850
I think what constraints that is is it's an open system

1148
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,460
 right 

1149
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,910
But it's possible 

1150
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,960
It's plausible 

1151
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,410
I think the bigger question 

1152
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,710
And there's been a numerous echo 

1153
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:24,240
Numerous academic papers around this is what happens if the mining pools come together and try to do what's called a 51% attack and try to take over the blockchain 

1154
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,170
And that's a more interesting challenge 

1155
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:31,510
And we'll talk about that throughout the semester 

1156
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,760
And it hasn't happened as of yet 

1157
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:37,630
Let me

1158
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,800
 let me talk about the native currencies 

1159
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,820
Native currency helps 

1160
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,710
Do all of this 

1161
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,530
What's Nakamoto said is it was an incentive system 

1162
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,860
It was an incentive system

1163
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:54,480
 but it was also peer-to-peer way to create a new money and embedded in most blockchains

1164
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,780
 not 100% of them 

1165
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,970
There is something I put quotes around it 

1166
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,440
Monetary policy

1167
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,050
 in essence

1168
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:04,970
 that limits the supply of the currency 

1169
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,860
Not every blockchain has this

1170
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,970
 but the vast majority do 

1171
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,650
And when we start talking about ownership coin offerings

1172
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,090
 you'll find some that don't think

1173
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,570
 but Bitcoin limits it 

1174
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,420
And I'm just going to say what it is 

1175
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,760
It's created in a Coinbase transaction in each block 

1176
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,140
It was initially 50 bitcoins per block 

1177
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:35,380
But now now because it's halved every 210000 blocks

1178
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,560
 it's just 12

1179
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,060
5 bitcoins 

1180
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:38,710
That's

1181
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,970
 that's the number of bitcoins you earn each time 

1182
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:46,650
If you mine a block that's approximately $75000 in value 

1183
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:46,840
Today

1184
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,350
 a giver taker 80000

1185
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,540
 roughly to mine a bloc 

1186
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:56,040
The inflation rate for Bitcoin right now is 41% 

1187
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:09,360
So think for any of you that have taken monetary policy courses or financial courses that talk about the federal reserve Bitcoin is growing about 4% a year right now

1188
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:14,210
 but it has every 210000 blocks 

1189
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,440
So the inflation rate will go down to 2% 

1190
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,940
And then later to about 1% and later about a half a percent 

1191
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,110
And it caps around the year 2040 

1192
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:29,900
And so whether Satoshi was one person or a team of people back in 2008

1193
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:36,780
 they put in place a monetary policy that is hardcoded into the computer base code 

1194
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:45,290
And it's supposedly gonna be there forever to cap Bitcoin at 21 million Bitcoin 

1195
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:57,390
I'm going to throw up ether just because it's an alternative currently that minds three F per block and the inflation rates about 7

1196
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,240
5 percent in that's a different stage

1197
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,010
 a development

1198
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,630
 different inflation rate 

1199
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,610
But there's been a proposal recently to literally

1200
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,970
 it was a proposal by the programmers 

1201
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,590
We should really lower the inflation rate 

1202
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,400
And if it's accepted

1203
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,140
 it will be adopted in November 

1204
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:29,320
The fees the fees in Ethereum are largely paid in something called gas gas is just a small unit of Ethereum

1205
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,950
 what's the small unit of Bitcoin

1206
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,230
 Satoshi 

1207
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,030
So gas and Satoshi are very similar British 

1208
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,769
I think the limit of 21 million is wished at 29th

1209
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:43,301
 14

1210
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,010
 not 24 

1211
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,170
Wait

1212
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,700
 did it's not 2040

1213
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,270
 21 point 

1214
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:48,170
Oh

1215
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,000
 yes

1216
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:50,420
 Wait

1217
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,830
 you think it's 21 40 closing out 

1218
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,100
What's that 

1219
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:57,850
All right 

1220
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:00,950
So I typed poorly 

1221
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,010
Aviva

1222
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:03,900
 did you have question 

1223
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,450
I

1224
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:10,070
 this means Bitcoin is a deflationary currency 

1225
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,050
Well

1226
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,880
 Eileen says it's Bitcoin and deflationary currency

1227
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,110
 depending upon

1228
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,300
 your use of that word 

1229
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:24,390
But others have written that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency because it's not growing 

1230
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:31,360
If the economy is growing at explicit and x percent is bigger than how Bitcoin is growing

1231
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:31,930
 that would

1232
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:35,340
 that would sort of define it as deflationary 

1233
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:44,210
I would just note that those who are fond and there's a lot of academic literature 

1234
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,780
And this goes back decades

1235
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,030
 if not centuries

1236
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,840
 for hard currencies

1237
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,450
 where monetary policy is absolutely formula driven

1238
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,900
 whether it's the Taylor rule or other rules

1239
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:02,490
 rulebased monetary policy would have a fondness for what you could maybe put in computer code 

1240
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,220
Those who think that humans should be involved 

1241
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:13,570
And many people think there is a need for some human involvement would say this is too hard coded

1242
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:17,080
 and you'd want something where you could modify and change it

1243
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,820
 and it would be dangerous

1244
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:30,320
 in times of war and times of stress and times of economic peril or like the 2008 crisis that this would make a crisis worse 

1245
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:46,010
And so the academic literature and the real life reality in the last couple of hundred years of hard currencies hard monetary policies versus human involvement and some judgment is kind of an an interesting debate that goes right in the middle of all of this

1246
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:51,273
 what we consider it is a reincarnation of art is an aspect 

1247
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:54,977
It's a class of asset that has some aspects of the cars 

1248
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:56,458
So the question is

1249
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,433
 is this is a real currency 

1250
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:03,150
Or is it just a asset that has aspects of of the currency 

1251
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:03,450
Ben

1252
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,290
 what do you think 

1253
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,600
So there were the three rolls and or three places you could define a currency 

1254
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,540
It was the unit of account store value

1255
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,090
 medium of exchange 

1256
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,780
So I guess this has all of those attributes you could call it accounts 

1257
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,781
You're saying if it has all of those

1258
01:05:21,781 --> 01:05:22,619
 it does that 

1259
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:23,456
All right

1260
01:05:23,456 --> 01:05:23,736
 DOS

1261
01:05:23,736 --> 01:05:24,294
 alright

1262
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:24,573
 DOS

1263
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:25,970
 so Ben thinks yes 

1264
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,924
How many people were within 

1265
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,600
As of September 18th

1266
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,690
 2018

1267
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,360
 not 21

1268
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:32,790
 18 

1269
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,530
So Isabelle is there Zen 

1270
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,650
So how many people think

1271
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:39,960
 Tom 

1272
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,130
How many people think 

1273
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,700
Not right 

1274
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,010
I don't 

1275
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,150
I think that you all get to decide yourself 

1276
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,600
Mark Carney

1277
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,810
 who is the governor of the Bank of England

1278
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,460
 gave a speech earlier in the year

1279
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,510
 which is assigned at a later class 

1280
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,330
And he says

1281
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,260
 I don't think we should call him cryptocurrency 

1282
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,210
So they should be called crypto assets 

1283
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,910
They're not yet evidencing all three of these things 

1284
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,840
So that's Mark Carney

1285
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,730
 who I have great respect for 

1286
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,800
But there are others that say

1287
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,030
 no

1288
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,060
 it's evidencing enough 

1289
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,800
I would say this

1290
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,290
 though 

1291
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:21,940
It's plausible that they will they and this

1292
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,180
 this

1293
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,840
 if you take nothing else from the class

1294
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,720
 it's plausible in my view that they could not provide

1295
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,380
 you could have digital currency that does not have a central authority 

1296
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:33,680
I mean

1297
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,790
 I think that innovation is there

1298
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,930
 whether you call it a cryptocurrency or cryptoasset at this point in time

1299
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,440
 I leave to all of you

1300
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,880
 there won't be a right answer to that on any paper 

1301
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,680
You submit you can use whichever term 

1302
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,960
You think fits your thinking 

1303
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,820
I want to talk about the network 

1304
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:52,720
We only have 10 minutes

1305
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,210
 but the network is important 

1306
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,820
And a lot of times when you talk about Bitcoin and blockchain

1307
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,170
 folks aren't going to talk about it

1308
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:02,890
 But I want to quickly hit 8 or 9 players on the network 

1309
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,470
There are full nodes 

1310
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,710
A full node is

1311
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,990
 is a group is a computer 

1312
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:13,290
I should say that stores the full blockchain technology

1313
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,470
 and is able to validate all transactions 

1314
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,800
It doesn't have to 

1315
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,420
It's a volunteer thing

1316
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,910
 but it can validate all transactions are a pruning node 

1317
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,920
You're not going to read a lot about it

1318
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,390
 But I just have it 

1319
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,090
It prunes transactions once they've validated and they have a certain age 

1320
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,470
You're saying

1321
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,710
 you know

1322
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,360
 all of those early transactions were not going to focus 

1323
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,340
There's been 

1324
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:49,940
Probably six times the number of transactions that have happened compared to the actual extent transactions right now 

1325
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,500
So all the transactions that have ever happened

1326
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,200
 5

1327
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,430
 6 of them have already been used 

1328
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,660
They're not around anymore 

1329
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,230
Why do we have to lug it around in our dataset 

1330
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,270
So you could have a pruning node

1331
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,760
 lightweight nodes

1332
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,690
 which if any of you have a Bitcoin wallet or any other wallet

1333
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,330
 you probably have a lightweight

1334
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,280
 some form of lightweight node or what's called an SPV node 

1335
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:23,310
It stores just those blockchain headers rather than all this detail underneath a lot less storage 

1336
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:31,170
But a lightweight node has to rely on the full nodes for verification because the lightweight node is not going to be doing that 

1337
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,020
And so on 

1338
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:32,930
Miners

1339
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,460
 we talked about miners 

1340
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,440
I want to just mention miners don't have to be full nodes 

1341
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,010
Amanda

1342
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:46,300
 you're running this mining operation for the whole class

1343
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,930
 and we're paying you 1 to 3% 

1344
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,010
But you're so you're Sloan

1345
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:53,740
 right 

1346
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,720
You're probably charging at the high end

1347
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:56,240
 right 

1348
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,590
So do you think that Amanda

1349
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:04,150
 as a mining pool operators operating a full node 

1350
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:06,620
Hi

1351
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,290
 Tom

1352
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:07,670
 Yes

1353
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,880
 saying it tentatively 

1354
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
But Tom

1355
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,260
 you're paying a man to 2% of your fees 

1356
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,210
Don't you want to make sure she's validating everything 

1357
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,300
Yeah

1358
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,950
 what's that 

1359
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,840
She just thinks

1360
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:20,980
 oh

1361
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:21,990
 she thinks three per cent 

1362
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,190
But

1363
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,620
 but any of you who are just miners

1364
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,430
 remember

1365
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,590
 Amanda is our pool operator

1366
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,940
 anybody's Andrew

1367
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,370
 do you think you need a full note 

1368
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,730
If if Amanda is no

1369
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:38,000
 so a lot of miners are not operating full nodes

1370
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,230
 they've got all those racks of Asics 

1371
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:45,390
They're running all their electricity and they are paying a man at a check on it 

1372
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,930
Don't let them down a link 

1373
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,890
I think this is a terrible thing because in principle

1374
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,780
 you have like 2030 mining codes

1375
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,170
 which means you have 2030 computers

1376
01:09:56,330 --> 01:10:04,540
 which validate the neural deposit block and sort of the thing that everybody wants to believe is that these systems are decentralized and you have thousands 

1377
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:10,260
So I might start calling you Norio Rabbini

1378
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:10,810
 but I won't 

1379
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,420
But Norio Rabbini

1380
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,570
 who is an economist

1381
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,350
 he sometimes called Dr Doom

1382
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,970
 and he likes that phrase because he caused downturns in the market 

1383
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:21,650
There's

1384
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:31,320
 there's a later reading and I might have even done a video of Rabbi has this video that it's not decentralized in mining pools or at Achilles heel of the system

1385
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,710
 but the full nodes

1386
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:36,690
 the 10000 nodes actually still do validation 

1387
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,950
And there's an interesting social construct where there's a lot of nodes doing in innocence

1388
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,580
 noncompensated work

1389
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:52,910
 validating transactions beyond Amanda and any minor Andrew could could validate if he wants to 

1390
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:58,430
So there's a lot of free riding that goes along and the economics of free riding 

1391
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,090
And then there's wallets

1392
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,400
 which probably 30 or 40 of you have when your computer somewhere

1393
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:09,300
 they store and view and send all the transactions 

1394
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,010
But importantly

1395
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,960
 also create the key pairs 

1396
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,910
So a lot to cover 

1397
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,550
There's one that's not a node itself at all 

1398
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,990
It's called the mempool or the memory pool 

1399
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,950
And we're going to talk about this more on Thursday 

1400
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:31,760
But the memory poll stores all the unconfirmed and but yet already validated 

1401
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,650
So they've been validated by somebody 

1402
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,840
A transaction goes out into the network 

1403
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,930
A full node validates it is

1404
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,950
 and it's put in a memory pool 

1405
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:46,860
And Amanda grabs the memory pool and sends it out to everybody in this class in a block 

1406
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,180
And then we mine it 

1407
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,550
We're not going to chat much about these right now 

1408
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,690
But we talked about there was a Coindesk article 

1409
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,050
How many of you actually skimmed 

1410
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:58,820
It looked at it 

1411
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:03,410
And did it mean anything to you or just meant that there's some alternative 

1412
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,810
What's that 

1413
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,480
Priya 

1414
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,180
Is that there's some alternative 

1415
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,110
That's what it meant to me 

1416
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,840
The first time I looked into this about 6 months ago 

1417
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,510
But I want to just mention what the alternatives come down to 

1418
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,880
They generally randomized or delegate the selection 

1419
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:29,230
So rather than rather than saying any one of 10000 nodes can prove that this works and it

1420
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:37,270
 they use various mathematical means randomized or delegated 

1421
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:44,940
And sometimes they do a little bit of delegation and randomization to pick who's going to validate the next block 

1422
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:49,110
It all comes down to who is picking the next block 

1423
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:54,550
Is it by Adam Beck's sort of as Satoshi Nakamoto 

1424
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,670
Put out there 

1425
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,940
We'll call it Nakamoto consensus proof of work 

1426
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:06,660
And you'll you'll have a paper for Thursday that talks about Nakamoto consensus

1427
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,860
 the Clark paper 

1428
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:14,220
But or is there some other randomized delegated way to do it 

1429
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,310
In some of them

1430
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,620
 they have a second check 

1431
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,720
If there's a delegated person to validate something

1432
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:30,620
 They put a second check in there that there is another group that that officiates and says whether it's correct 

1433
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,060
And so there's proof of stake

1434
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,300
 which is based on the stake you have in the underlying currency 

1435
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,960
There's proof of activity

1436
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,190
 which is kind of a high bread of proof of work and proof of stake 

1437
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,510
Proof of burn 

1438
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,230
Are you willing to give up coins 

1439
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,020
A proof of capacity 

1440
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,750
Do you have storage capacity 

1441
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,640
And you might have a tiered system 

1442
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:54,980
And the major

1443
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,280
 permissionless blockchains all use proof of work 

1444
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:02,820
And the reason is nobody's really solved all of these other alternatives 

1445
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:07,300
No one's really solved for a couple of problems in them 

1446
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:17,550
But they usually find a way to be more efficient through delegation and randomization and might have a backup set of checks on it 

1447
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,390
Dash and Neo will say that they use proof of steak

1448
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:28,190
 but they're actually kind of using some form of of master nodes or or or set up professional nodes 

1449
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,190
But Dash and Neo are kind of

1450
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:36,370
 I think the 13th and 15th largest market value cryptos

1451
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,240
 which means everything else kind of and ripple

1452
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,700
 doesn't 

1453
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:39,840
It 

1454
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,030
Ripples really almost like a permission system rather than permissionless 

1455
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,280
I mean

1456
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,500
 they would say they're permissionless

1457
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:52,640
 but it's a confirm firm set of nodes that in the node system 

1458
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,170
So that's it for today 

1459
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,090
We're going to do transactions 

1460
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,060
On Thursday

1461
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,250
 I moved that study question 

1462
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:05,510
And then I'm going to ask you to read through the Clark paper

1463
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,480
 which is really the academic pedigree 

1464
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,740
Where is this built on 

1465
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:10,820
What's the background 

1466
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,190
But I think it's a good way to bring it all together 

1467
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,130
And remember

1468
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,020
 on Thursday

1469
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,300
 you all come in to answer this question

1470
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,560
 your own view as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is 

1471
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,700
There is no right answer 

1472
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,160
But of MIT S blockchain money class can answer that 

1473
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,650
I'm sure that we'll get a right up somewhere about it
